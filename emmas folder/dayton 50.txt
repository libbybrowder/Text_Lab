A new building is coming to Miami University's Oxford campus courtesy of one of the largest financial donations in the school's history.
Miami officials announced a $20 million gift from a graduate now high-profile business executive to build a data science building scheduled to open in 2023.
 The $20 million gift from Rick McVey – a 1981 Miami graduate – will lead to the creation of the Richard M. McVey Data Science Building in his honor.
 The 85,000-square foot building, which will begin construction next year, will be located along Tallawanda Road on the Oxford campus near Withrow Hall and Benton Hall.
 Miami to build $96M academic building, first in more than a decade
 Miami officials released a statement noting the new building "will house one of Miami's newest departments, Emerging Technology in Business and Design, as well as the departments of statistics and mathematics, the Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies, and the Center for Analytics and Data Science."
 Miami President Greg Crawford said this gift – which school officials said is one of the five largest donations in Miami history – will be central to making Miami's vision of creating an academic epicenter for data science a reality.
 "An interdisciplinary team of faculty and staff have been working on a design for this building that will transform our academic programs related to data science and digital technology. This gift makes that vision a reality," Crawford said. "We are so grateful to Rick for his leadership, extraordinary generosity and his dedicated service to his alma mater."
 As the founder, chairman and CEO of New York-based MarketAxess, a leading international financial technology company and now part of the S&P 500 Stock Index, McVey is passionate about ensuring that Miami continues to advance the field of data science.
 "Data science and artificial intelligence are having a profound impact on all sectors of the economy, and especially here at MarketAxess," McVey said. "The demand for data science skills is growing rapidly in every industry. It is gratifying to help Miami build a distinctive program with this gift, which will increase access to data science programs for Miami students for many decades to come."
 McVey, whose daughter Taylor is a 2011 Miami alumna, has been a longtime supporter of the university.
 He earned a B.S. in finance at Miami and was co-captain of the MAC-champion Miami golf team in 1981. McVey has been a generous supporter of both areas, endowing scholarships for Miami's golf program and for the Farmer School of Business. He also serves as a member of the Miami University Foundation Board of Directors, where he is chair of the investment committee for the Miami endowment.

Committed to expanding opportunities for students, Wittenberg University has launched a new, innovative data science program within the liberal arts tradition.
A technical major consisting primarily of statistics and computer science courses, data science involves gaining expertise in scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge from data in various forms and to unify statistics and data analysis in order to understand occurrences.
The new major is housed within Wittenberg's department of mathematics and computer science. In addition to this new data science major, the department has created new computer science and cybersecurity majors recently, and revised its math major and its math major with a concentration in statistics.
"This is an exciting major that will lead to high-paying jobs for our students," said Adam Parker, associate professor of mathematics and department chair. "Students in this program are quantitatively minded and interested in developing the statistical and programming skills to gain new knowledge and insights from data."
According to an article from Forbes, the median salary of ajunior-level data scientist is $91,000, and those managing a team of 10 or more data scientists have an earning potential of more than $250,000 per year. The abundance of job prospects and the higher salary range are in part because of the shortage of data scientists, which drove Wittenberg to offer the major. In fact, the McKinsey Global Institute recently released a survey indicating that by 2018 there will be a shortage of 190,000 skilled data scientists in the United States alone. These are the reasons that the Harvard Business Review called data science "the sexiest Job of the 21st century" and CNBC just listed data scientist as the "No. 1 best job" of 2017.
The data scientist is a high-ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data. The title has come about because of the volume of information that is now available as a result of new technology.
In addition to the major, a minor in data science compliments many existing majors at Wittenberg and makes those graduates even more marketable. Any major - business or political science or environmental science - where data is being collected would benefit from the statistical expertise and computer skills to sort through and analyze the massive amounts of data being created in those fields.
A number of Wittenberg alumni are currently working in data science, and many were contacted to help design the major so that it includes the skills most useful in the field.
"Data science is a great addition to Wittenberg's offerings, as it plays on strengths we already have in a traditional liberal arts discipline of mathematics," said Allison Scaia '09, an assistant vice president in claims operational analytics at the Hartford Insurance Group. "I can't emphasize enough the importance of having a well-rounded data scientist who has gone through a liberal arts curriculum. It's imperative that data scientists have strong critical thinking skills and express curiosity, as well as strong communication skills. The liberal arts foundation at Wittenberg gives students a strong foundation to be successful after leaving Wittenberg. I would have loved to have data science as a major."
Wittenberg's program will allow students to gain practical and theoretical knowledge in the context of a liberal arts education, equipping them with the skills needed for success in data science field.
"In our highly connected, technology-driven society, data is at the intersection of everything we do," said Steve Dennett '07, data scientist with NetJets. "New data, and therefore new problems, are being generated at a breakneck pace, and I have seen firsthand the need for more graduates with a well-rounded data science education to work on these problems. From science to the arts, from industry to government, no matter what a student's interests may be, there are data problems to be solved."

Wittenberg will introduce a new science-based degree program next year that will give students more opportunities to study statistics, math and business.
Adam Parker, the chair for department of mathematics and computer science at Wittenberg, said the new data science major is a growing field.
"This is meant to fill that need in the market space," Parker said. "These are students that have a lot of statistics, a lot of computer science and enough business so they can communicate with those high-level thinkers in order to make decisions for a business or a hospital or a college."
Wittenberg is a major local employer with a total of more than 250 employees and has an estimated $70 million economic impact on the Springfield community. The data science program is another addition to the university as it works to keep its core as a liberal arts college intact while providing degree options that are in demand and provide high-paying jobs.
Allison Scaia, a Wittenberg alum and assistant vice president-claims operational analytic at The Hartford, said a data science degree paired with a liberal arts background can make for a strong candidate in the work force.
"It's imperative that data scientists have strong critical thinking skills and express curiosity as well as strong communication skills," she said.
Communication is key, Parker said, and a Wittenberg graduate with a data science degree will be highly sought after.
"Because our students have strong writing and speaking skills, they also are in demand because they can communicate with the people who are making decisions higher up," Parker said. "They are not just going to be people in a dark room doing data analysis. They are going to be interacting with lots of different people."
Someone with a data science degree can get a job in many different fields, he said.
"This is really expanding outside of business," Parker said. "It is very important for advertising, in terms of segmenting a population. The more you can segment and reach a target population, the more successful you will be."
Schools, hospitals and even athletic teams are looking at data more often to make the right decisions.
Kenneth Kukier, a senior editor of The Economist and a Wittenberg graduate, said data science continues to grow.
"It has an impact on all fields," he said. "The same sort of sophistication of working with data that has long been part of the general sciences is now moving into all areas of life."
Wittenberg has more than 1,800 students enrolled and has a goal to increase enrollment to 2,000. Parker said the timing of the new degree is what could separate Wittenberg from other universities and attract more students to campus.
"This is a chance to be on the leading edge of something," he said. "Data science is a new field, a hot field. In 2017 it was named the best job in America. This is a hot area of the marketplace and getting in here early speaks well for Wittenberg."

ETHICS COME TO TECHNOLOGY; Universities hustle to bring medicine-like morality to Silicon Valley. At Stanford, a computer science ethics course is being developed.; COVER STORY

(From left) Jeremy Weinstein, Hilary Cohen, Mehran Sahami and Rob Reich are shown in the William Gates Computer Science Building at Stanford University. Schools like Stanford that helped produce some of Silicon Valley's most prominent leaders are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.
Laura Nor&#233;n, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University, teaches a course on ethics in data science at New York University in New York last month.
PALO ALTO, CALIF. - The medical profession has an ethic: First, do no harm.
Silicon Valley has an ethos: Build it first and ask for forgiveness later.
Now, in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies, universities that helped produce some of Silicon Valley's top technologists are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.
This semester, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are jointly offering a new course on the ethics and regulation of artificial intelligence. The University of Texas at Austin just introduced a course titled "Ethical Foundations of Computer Science" - with the idea of eventually requiring it for all computer science majors.
And at Stanford University, the academic heart of the industry, three professors and a research fellow are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. They hope several hundred students will enroll.
The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations - like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars - before those products go on sale.
"It's about finding or identifying issues that we know in the next two, three, five, 10 years, the students who graduate from here are going to have to grapple with," said Mehran Sahami, a popular computer science professor at Stanford who is helping to develop the course. He is renowned on campus for bringing Mark Zuckerberg to class.
"Technology is not neutral," said Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. "The choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications."
The courses are emerging at a moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects - fake news on Facebook, fake followers on Twitter, lewd children's videos on YouTube - of the industry's build-it-first mindset. They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance.
"We need to at least teach people that there's a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things," said Laura Norén, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester. "You can patch the software, but you can't patch a person if you, you know, damage someone's reputation."
Computer science programs are required to make sure students have an understanding of ethical issues related to computing in order to be accredited by ABET, a global accreditation group for university science and engineering programs. Some computer science departments have folded the topic into a broader class, and others have stand-alone courses.
But until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.
"Compared to transportation or doctors, your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is a lot less if you are writing software for apps," said Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab.
One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning - computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-MIT ethics course.
"As we start to see things,
like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics," he said. (Ito is a director of The New York Times Company.)
This past fall, Cornell University introduced a data science course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges - such as biased data sets that include too few lower-income households to be representative of the general population. Students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life-changing decisions such as hiring or college admissions.
"It was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as a data scientist they are likely to confront, and to help them think through those challenges more systematically," said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor in information science who taught the course.
In another Cornell course, Karen Levy, also an assistant professor in information science, is teaching her students to focus more on the ethics of tech companies.
"A lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data," Levy said. "If data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise."
The Harvard-MIT course, which has 30 students, focuses on the ethical, policy and legal implications of artificial intelligence. It was spurred and financed in part by a new artificial intelligence ethics research fund whose donors include Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, and the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm of Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder.
The curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data - such as whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records - to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions, such as: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?
Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled "Ethics, Public Policy and Computer Science."
The expectations for the course are running high in part because of Sahami's popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.
The new ethics course covers topics such as artificial intelligence and autonomous machines; privacy and civil rights; and platforms like Facebook. Rob Reich, a Stanford political science professor who is helping to develop the course, said students would be asked to consider those topics from the point of view of software engineers, product designers and policymakers. Students will also be assigned to translate ideal solutions into computer code.
"Stanford absolutely has a responsibility to play a leadership role in integrating these perspectives, but so does Carnegie Mellon and Caltech and Berkeley and MIT," said Jeremy Weinstein, a Stanford political science professor and co-developer of the ethics course. "The set of institutions that are generating the next generation of leaders in the technology sector have all got to get on this train."

You can choose romance books that fit different categories and see their "Steaminess Score," as well.
You devour romance novels to get to - OK, admit it - the steamiest parts.
If the above describes you, you're the type of person Audible is trying to seduce into subscribing to a new service launching Wednesday called Audible Romance. It promises romance fans unlimited access to more than 10,000 audiobooks that fit the romance spectrum, from Jane Austen to erotica.
Amazon-owned Audible is the largest seller of narrated books and spoken content, with more than 400,000 titles overall, and "romance is not an easily and singularly defined term," said Audible's chief content officer, Andy Gaies.
Audible Romance costs $14.95 a month as a stand-alone offering or $6.95 a month as an add-on for those who already pay $14.95 month for Audible's core service. A regular Audible subscription gives listeners one credit toward an Audible title each month, plus a discount on purchased audio-books. If you tend to buy a lot of romance-oriented bestsellers under the core plan, you might come out ahead with the new offering.
Romance fans are "voracious consumers of content," Gaies said, and "on the cutting edge of digital."
The company says 103 of the top 153 bestselling romance authors, such names as Nora Roberts, Robyn Carr, Sylvia Day and Debbie Macomber, will have works included in the service.
There seems little doubt that Audible thinks sex sells, judging by one of the main features behind the new service. It's called "Take Me to the Good Part." Audible says the feature was driven by machine learning and data science.
Another new feature, also driven by data science, is a "Steaminess Score" that is supposed to help clue you in on the level of "passion" you can expect from a given audiobook. The scale: Sweet, Simmering, Sizzling, Hot Damn and O-O-OMG. Audible says its team developed these categorizations through an algorithm that scans each title to look for key words that trigger "steamy" markers.
Blair Underwood, Dermot Mulroney and Jesse Metcalf are among those voicing the material.
Meanwhile, lest you think the designated "good" parts are all about the hottest encounters, they also cover flirty banter and first meetings.
"We don't want to define what good parts to one person would mean to another," said Audible's chief financial officer, Cynthia Chu, who leads the data science team.

Butler County blight busting tool to get review

BUTLER COUNTY
The Butler County land bank will once again look to Miami University students to give them a cost/benefit analysis of the blight busting tool.
 Miami University students in the Center for Analytics & Data Science spent months analyzing data three years ago, to try to determine whether bringing down blight was achieving the goal of stabilizing neighborhoods.
 MORE: Butler County might branch into commercial blight demolition
 Since its inception the land bank has razed 372 eyesores in Hamilton and 265 in Middletown at a total cost of $7.3 million, the lion's share paid for with state and federal funds. Land bank President Mike McNamara said because more eyesores have been removed since the first study published in spring 2016, it is critical for them to refresh the analysis.
 "Gathering and analyzing information about our programs is essential in the decision-making process," he said. "The baseline study that we did in 2016 served to validate what we've been doing so far… I think that ongoing benchmark of understanding the long-term impact of the land bank is important in making decisions on how we approach blight elimination and land re-utilization."
 RELATED: Butler County land bank getting results
 The students found property values of homes within a 500-foot radius of a downed eyesore increased 29.65 percent in Hamilton but a "statistically insignificant" amount in Middletown.
 Meanwhile, banishing blight in Middletown had a positive effect on foreclosures but the results were not the same for Hamilton.
 "In determining the effectiveness of the Land Bank thus far, the results of the current analysis suggest the possibility of positive spillover effects related to blight removal," the students wrote. "Specifically, blight removal is associated with higher home values (in Hamilton) and lower incidences of foreclosure (in Middletown)."
 Middletown City Manager Doug Adkins said there are a lot of studies out there that tout the success of land banks but a personalized approach here is valuable.
 "Although there are studies around the United States that document the benefits associated with removing blight and returning tax delinquent property to productive use," he said. "It's important that the Butler County Land Reutilization Corporation consistently evaluate the results of our work specific to the local impact on Butler County parcels."
 A 500 percent leap from about 500 to 3,000 foreclosures between 1999 and 2010 prompted the establishment of the land bank in 2012. There was also state money available the cities of Hamilton and Middletown wanted to tap into. In the beginning only the two largest cities were members of the land bank because they ponied up $1.1 million each in order to collect Moving Ohio Forward monies.
 Since then millions more has come available through the federal Hardest Hit Fund Program and a one percent cut of delinquent tax assessment and collections funds (DTAC).
 County Treasurer Nancy Nix, who is chairman of the land bank board and chiefly responsible for bringing the local land bank to fruition, urged the commissioners several years ago to allow siphoning DTAC for the land bank. She said they needed the local match dollars to cull more outside funding and it also allowed the land bank to open its membership to other jurisdictions.
 Membership in the land bank now includes: Fairfield, Hamilton, Middletown, Seven Mile, Trenton and Fairfield, Hanover, Lemon, Liberty, Madison, Oxford, Ross, St. Clair and Wayne townships.
 The land bank considered asking the county commissioners for more DTAC funding — that funding source brought in $145,255 last year — recently but decided their one percent was adequate for now. The commissioners were a bit reticent to do so since it takes away from other jurisdictions like schools that get a share.
 The commissioners also treaded very cautiously early on when the land bank asked to use expedited foreclosures — which allows sidestepping multiple sheriff sales — in order to meet quickly looming deadlines for the HHF federal program.
 Commissioner Don Dixon said he is well pleased with the county's blight eradication tool.
 "I think you have to continue to keep moving forward or you move backwards," Dixon said. "Our board is constantly looking for new innovative ways to be able to use it and do more commercial demolition and larger projects, so I think the study is important, but it (the land bank focus) changes daily and it changes as the economy changes. In one year you'll have different needs than another year."
 McNamara said a Miami intern will be working in his office culling data from a number of sources this summer — and will be paid a stipend — including foreclosures, home sales, information from the cities, even crime stats as part of the larger study.
 Allison Jones-Farmer, the Van Andel Professor of Business Analytics & Director of the Center for Analytics and Data Science at Miami, said with several more years of data now available, a more robust picture of the land bank's performance will be possible. She said for the first study they had a pretty short time frame from which to draw conclusions.
 "I don't have a good grasp of sort of the frequency of the blight removal at this point and how well distributed that is over the cities," she said. "But we hope that it is of such that we'll be able to draw some better inferences as to what impact the land bank has had on the community… It's hopeful over this time horizon we'll be able to get a more solid grasp of what it's doing."

Saranga Komanduri, 38, Technical Lead at Civis Analytics tries to help companies be more data driven in their decision-making. This is the magic of data science. You can take a person, and you can have thousands of attributes, pieces of information about that person, and throw that against a modeling algorithm, and get back which of those attributes matter and which of them don't for whatever outcome you're trying to measure.
I didn't personally work on the campaign, but during Obama 2012, our CEO, Dan Wagner, was chief data scientist of the Obama campaign. There's a lot of technology that gets built during a campaign that sort of disappears when the campaign disappears. Eric Schmidt of Google, who was heavily involved with the campaign, was trying to change that. So he funded Civis Analytics to keep those brains together and see if they could take that data science and data analytics experience and bring it to other domains and other companies.
I manage a small team of, right now, two other engineers that work on the back-end infrastructure of our platform. When you want to solve a problem with the Civis platform, you want to build a model around data and make some predictions. We write the code that does the computation.
I've been into computers since I was very young. We had a personal computer at home, an IBM, so I would play with it quite a bit. I used to write programs in it.
I went to school for computer engineering, and I actually didn't really like it at all. I was an undergrad at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and I dropped out completely. My parents were very unhappy.
I got a job at Best Buy working at the service bench, which eventually became the Geek Squad. So then I started working there, and I moved from there into working with the local county government in Toledo, doing their information technology.
I think I was 28 when I decided I wanted to go back and get a degree. I went to Bowling Green State University and looked at what degree I could graduate the fastest with, and it was computer science. One of my professors asked me if I wanted to do a master's, and they would fund me as long as I did an assistantship.
In the course of doing my master's, I realized I actually really liked computer science. It's easy to think of a programmer as someone who just sits in front of a computer and writes code all day. But the actual problems you're thinking about and solving are very interesting. Sometime later, I went to Carnegie Mellon (University) in Pittsburgh for a Ph.D. in computer science. My thesis was on modeling the strength of passwords.
While I was still completing my Ph.D., I applied to a small amount of places in Chicago that looked interesting, and one of them was Civis. When I started at Civis, I was finishing my Ph.D., and my wife and I moved to Lisle, Ill., and had a baby. So it was sort of a lot.
One thing that's really nice about working here is how much you can learn about other stuff just being here. There's a journal club that I'm a part of. So every Friday we meet, and if anyone has read any interesting papers that week, they present them at journal club.
We also do lightning talks once a month. They're five-minute talks about any topic you want. One person did a lightning talk about their childhood, about how they grew up. Someone did a lightning talk about how they built their house. There are a lot of food ones. Or beer.
We also have this thing called Wizard School once a week. It's basically teaching programming fundamentals. It's called Wizard School because the book that's used has a picture of a wizard on it.
The perks are things like the Big Table. It seats about 20 to
25. A lot of people will go out and get a lunch and come back to the big table so they can be part of the conversation. It's just a very laid-back environment.
When I started, I think there were 60 employees, and now we're at 110. The culture is very open. It's very collaborative. It kind of has to be because every part of the organization depends on another part of the organization to get work done.

Students at the Air Force Institute of Technology rapidly developed a predictive modeling app called COVID-19 Health Assessment Dashboard (CHAD) to provide a centralized location for Air Force leadership to receive up-to-date pandemic information specifically tailored to military installations and the surrounding local areas.
Four operations research graduate students, in response to an AF/A9 request for AFIT support in COVID-19 analysis, developed the dashboard. In less than two weeks, Capt. James Deitschel, Capt. Garrett Alarcon, 1st Lt. Nicholas Forrest and 1st Lt. Trey Pujats envisioned, constructed and deployed an online predictive modeling app that provides Air Force leadership situational awareness projections for the number of infected individuals and the impact on local hospitals.
 "The objective was to provide Air Force leaders with where, when and how bad the next hot spot of COVID-19 outbreak will be," said Deitschel. "Users can select any CONUS Air Force installation and an area between 25 to 100 miles from that installation. Results will include all of the counties within that radius. The dashboard is pulling in real-time data for hospitals, cases, and deaths. It provides charts, maps, and tables with the information of interest."
 "The CHAD project illustrates AFIT's capability to apply data science and analytics to help address important operational and readiness issues," said Dr. Todd Stewart, AFIT director and chancellor. "Our No. 1 priority at AFIT is to be relevant and responsive to the Air and Space Forces in all we do … teaching, research and consulting. The CHAD is a great example of putting that priority into practice".
 The "AFITeers" as the students became known, continue to improve CHAD by incorporating data and projections for OCONUS bases and MAJCOMs. CHAD now provides summaries for all installations and facilities across the Department of Defense, stateside and overseas. A recent major change includes an FOUO version that provides installations with current HPCON levels, gating criteria, and travel restrictions
 The student's work has been well received by Air Force leadership, and their contribution continues to inform policy decisions as part of the Air Force response to the COVID-19 crisis. As such, AF/A9 adopted continued development and support of the tool when the "AFITeers" graduated from AFIT and moved to their next assignments. The impact CHAD is having on senior level policy decisions cannot be understated.
 "We have deep respect for the leadership at AFIT and AF/A9 who believed in us and our product and poured their resources into making this the product it is today," said Alarcon. "Without them, this would not have made it to where it is."
 "We are extremely proud of these four recent AFIT graduates and of the faculty who advised them in developing the CHAD," said Stewart. "This is an excellent example of AFIT's capability to prepare its students to help the U.S. Air and Space Forces quickly respond to high-priority requirements, by offering innovative, practical solutions, to help our commanders and other leaders make better-informed decisions.

Start-up aims to make fundraising effective; Presidential campaign inspires duo's efforts.

Last fall, Matt Oczkowski and Parks Bennett were logging 12-hour days in a rented office in San Antonio that smelled of Chick-fil-A and Doritos, focused on one mission: to elect Donald Trump president.
As they raced to crunch voter data and build up Trump's small-donor base, an idea began to jell: Could they apply data science to make email fundraising more effective and transparent?
The concept, which the two young GOP digital strategists had begun discussing earlier in the cycle while working for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's presidential bid, is the heart of a company they're formally launching called Campaign Inbox.
"There has to be some innovation in this space," said Oczkowski, who led the data science efforts for the Trump campaign as head of product for Cambridge Analytica, a company backed by hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer. "We didn't see a solution in the marketplace that really fit with what we wanted, so we just decided to do it ourselves."
The venture is the first known startup to emerge from Trump's White House run - the latest example of how presidential campaigns serve as hothouses for new enterprises, particularly in the technological space.
"We always call campaigns the world's greatest startups, because one day you have no money and no entity and the next day you have a million dollars and are ready to go," said Lee Dunn, who headed Google's elections advertising team in 2016. Campaigns, she noted, "throw crazy ideas out there, they discard and start anew, they act fast."
President Barack Obama's two presidential bids, for example, birthed a slew of enterprises such as Optimizely, a website optimization company, and Modest, a mobile commerce platform eventually acquired by PayPal.
"There is an energy that does push innovation and gives people space to explore it," said Betsy Hoover, who served as Obama's national digital organizing director in 2012.
Earlier this month, Hoover and other Obama campaign alumni launched a business incubator called Higher Ground Labs that aims to provide investment to early-stage political tech companies on the left.
"If we don't build this ecosystem, we do risk being outpaced by the Republicans," she said. "They did some things in 2016 that pushed the envelope."
Trump's tech operation was based in San Antonio, headed by chief digital strategist Brad Parscale. At its peak, the team - which included staff from Parscale's company, the campaign, the Republican National Committee and contractors - numbered a few hundred. They worked out of an office space near the airport that had been hurriedly fashioned into a campaign-like bullpen.
Dunn, who visited occasionally from Washington, said she was impressed with how Oczkowski and Bennett sought to calibrate online messages by testing responses to news developments in real time. "I think they are leaders in a new generation that is starting to emerge in online advertising," she said.
As the head of the RNC's small donor program, Bennett oversaw an effort that generated millions for the Trump campaign and the party. But he said he thinks the returns could have been even greater if the campaign had a clearer sense of who was receiving their barrage of email solicitations.
"The biggest problem for me has been the lack of transparency when deploying an email," Bennett said. "You're just loading a list and hitting 'send' and crossing your fingers that it's actually going to make it into your intended user's inbox."
Unlike Democratic campaigns, which typically build donor lists by running online ads, GOP groups have relied heavily on email list brokers, who pocket commissions in exchange for access to email addresses they control.
Campaigns and committees often rent dozens of lists in an effort to hit as many potential donors as possible. In the 2016 campaign, the RNC and one of its joint fundraising committees with the Trump campaign spent more than $38 million on email list rentals, Federal Election Commission reports show.

WILBERFORCE —
The Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which includes Central State University in Wilberforce, announced Thursday it is suspending the fall sports season because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 » ARCHDEACON: Central State coach building field of dreams
 The decision comes on the same day the Big Ten Conference announced it will hold only conference games in all sports this fall, while the North Coast Athletic Conference pushed the start date of the fall sports season back to Sept. 19. Earlier in the week, the Ivy League cancelled its fall sports season. Back in May, Sinclair Community College suspended all sports for the entire 2020-21 academic year.
 For Central State, the decision means the football, volleyball and men's and women's cross country teams will not compete this fall.
 "We've been in communication and conversation with a lot of different entities — the Ohio Department of Health, the CDC, the NCAA and our conference office — dating back to March to decide our best course of action," said Central State Athletic Director Tara A. Owens. "Through a lot of careful consideration and thoughtful analysis, the SIAC member institutions came to a difficult but necessary decision to forgo fall competition."
 » CENTRAL STATE TRACK: Two champs deal with one hurdle no athlete could clear
 Central State will continue to honor the scholarships of affected athletes and will hold discussions about moving the fall sports to the spring. Owens said there was a more positive feeling about the potential of fall sports returning earlier this summer and in the spring.
 The large blueprint of the SIAC, which has schools in Ohio, Georgia, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama, also factored into the decision. All of those states are seeing increasing numbers of COVID-19.
 The conference includes Albany State University, Benedict College, Clark Atlanta University, Fort Valley State University, Kentucky State University, Lane College, LeMoyne-Owen College, Miles College, Morehouse College, Savannah State University, Spring Hill College, and Tuskegee University.
 » CORONAVIRUS: What's next for the sports world
 "The decision to extend the SIAC suspension into the fall of 2020 was guided by the prevailing data, science as well as current coronavirus infection trajectories," said SIAC Council of President Chairman George T. French, Jr. "In light of these very difficult realities, and in the context of the overarching priority of all of my colleague SIAC presidents to protect the health, wellness and safety of all of our students and staff, we are confident that the decision announced today is consistent with those fundamental health and safety priorities."
 Owens said she has been in constant communication with Central State coaches and prepared them for all potential scenarios.
 "I really commend our coaches for remaining composed during this unprecedented time," Owens said. "They've done a tremendous job of communicating with our student-athletes and just delivering the most positive message we could. ... Despite the challenges and disappointments, our student-athletes have shown great character throughout this entire process, and I'm really impressed with how they responded to the adversity."

WHEN AN ALGORITHM IS YOUR STYLIST; San Francisco's Stitch Fix uses Big Data to figure out what you'd like to wear, then sends it to you in a box to see whether you agree.; COVER SRORY

Dylan Pantuzzi, a technical design assistant, checks the measurement on a garment last month at Stitch Fix in San Francisco. Stitch Fix is an online fashion delivery service that ships personalized clothing to customers' doors. The company uses data analysis software and machine learning to come up with recommendations for its customers.
Brittany Busacca is a trend manager at Stitch Fix. The company's data science team can help provide valuable information about trends such as the popularity of the "cold shoulder" top: shirts with part of the shoulder or sleeve cut out.
High school music teacher Kelly Walker wears a Stitch Fix outfit as she runs a class at Willow Glen High in San Jose, Calif.
Eric Colson, chief algorithms officer at Stitch Fix in downtown San Francisco, prepares for a meeting last month. Stitch Fix learns a lot about a customer by what he or she returns, Colson said.
SAN FRANCISCO - The next time you see a well-dressed individual walking down the street, stop to consider this: that spiffy outfit might not be the result of an impeccable fashion sense - it might be the work of a computer algorithm.
At least, that could be the case if the fashionista is a customer of one of several services that offer fashion delivered on demand, such as San Francisco-based startup Stitch Fix. Using data analysis software and machine learning to match users with personalized clothing choices, Stitch Fix is ushering the fashion industry into the age of Big Data.
For customers who don't pry too closely into the startup's inner workings, the service is intended to feel like magic.
"All they're seeing is they order a box of clothes, and presto - it appears," said Eric Colson, Stitch Fix's chief algorithms officer.
Companies in a variety of industries are relying more heavily on data to provide personalized recommendations - think Netflix using algorithms to find movies or TV shows users might like, or Amazon suggesting additional purchases based on what's in someone's cart. Stitch Fix, which in September expanded into men's fashion as part of its ongoing effort to revolutionize the clothing industry, uses that same technology to deliver curated boxes of clothing to customers' doors.
The first time users try the 5-year-old service, they answer a few dozens questions about their size, style and the body parts they like to flaunt. Stitch Fix takes that data and plugs it into its algorithms, which come up with a list of clothing options. Then a human stylist reviews those choices, selects five items, and ships them. The customer has the option to buy the items or return them, free of charge. If the customer buys nothing, he or she pays a $20 styling fee per box.
Customers can schedule regular deliveries or order one box at a time. When signing up for the service, they choose from a range of clothing price options - including "the cheaper, the better."
Stitch Fix's software learns more about each customer every time he or she receives a shipment. The company asks what the customer liked or disliked about each item - using natural language processing to decode their written answers - and applies that data to the next shipment.
"I've seen the things that come in my box start to adapt to more what my personal style is," said Kelly Walker, a music teacher at Willow Glen High School in San Jose, Calif., who orders a Stitch Fix box every month.
Walker has been using Stitch Fix regularly for about a year and a half, and said she looks forward to receiving her box of goodies every month. She doesn't think much about the technology that drives the service, mostly because she and her human Stitch Fix stylist exchange personal notes on a regular basis.
During an interview on a recent Friday morning, Walker happened to be wearing a black-and-white top from Stitch Fix that she loves. But the company doesn't always get it right.
"One time definitely there was a sweater in there that I was like, 'umm, this isn't really my style,' " Walker said. "It was very loose and very baggy."
Stitch Fix learns a lot about a customer by analyzing what he or she returns, Colson said, especially because many people aren't good at articulating what they want the first time around.
"They may say they're preppy, but it turns out they're more of a classic or casual style," he said. "People may think they're a medium, but the medium - that "M" label - has a huge spectrum associated with it."
In some ways, Stitch Fix is a tech company masquerading as a fashion company. The startup employs 75 data scientists (out of 5,000 total employees). That's a bigger data science team than Apple, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google or Amazon had, according to a 2015 study by data firm Stitch (which is not affiliated with Stitch Fix).
StitchFix uses 50 different algorithms to conduct its day-to-day business. Aside from the formulas it uses to pick out clothes, it also has algorithms to assign each shopper to one of its 3,000 human stylists. Its tech systems figure out which Stitch Fix warehouse a client's clothes should come from, determine which styles and how many of each item Stitch Fix should stock and even design some custom pieces. And Stitch Fix can use its data to spot fashion trends. "Cold shoulder" tops - shirts with part of the shoulder or sleeve cut out - are especially hot right now, Colson said.
That high-tech capability likely will be the future of not just fashion, but every industry, said Rishi Garg, a partner with Menlo Park, Calif.-based venture capital firm Mayfield. As every company becomes a big data company, customers will start to expect those capabilities.
"It's definitely a trend and something that we're going to see more of," Garg said.
Stitch Fix isn't the only company that provides personalized style delivered. Chicago-based Trunk Club offers a similar service. So does New York-based Bombfell, a fashion delivery service for men that mines users' Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn pages for clues about their personal style.
All of those companies also play into the broader delivery craze sweeping the nation, especially targeting millennials who now can opt to have everything from groceries to eyeglasses to birth control arrive at their door. Companies that offer those services recognize something unpleasant about the retail experience - namely that it can be tedious and repetitive, Garg said.
"It reflects a desire to evolve what these retail experiences are like," he said, "and make them more comfortable."
While the convenience of on-demand delivery makes services like Stitch Fix increasingly popular, it comes at a cost to traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. In recent years, traditional retailers such as J.C. Penney, Macy's and Nordstrom have struggled amid growing competition from the likes of Stitch Fix.
The old-line retailers "are taking a hit," said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst of The NPD Group, who specializes in retail. "It has everything to do with the fact that fashion is lacking innovation."
Some retail stores are fighting back with high-tech solutions of their own, such as Lucky Brand, which installed smart fitting rooms in some locations that suggest clothes for shoppers and help them find items in the correct size.
There's an inherent sacrifice consumers face when they eschew a store in favor of delivery services, Cohen said.
"We lose the art of shopping," he said. "We lose the art of personalization."
Instead of crafting an individual style, shoppers rely on an algorithm or personal shopper to do it for them. And there's always the risk that the algorithm will get it wrong, leaving the customer with piles of clothes he or she doesn't want and a hefty delivery fee, Cohen said.
Stitch Fix agrees it's essential to get the matching right. If it's off, the company loses a customer and also loses money on shipping the return and on the cost of inventory while the item is out.
"We have to be very confident in our selections," Colson said. "Because if we get it wrong, we're going to be paying a lot."

Digital Hangar to support lifecycle management of aerospace systems

There is a new hangar under construction at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, but this one will not be made of steel and concrete but rather digital ones and zeros.
The Air Force Research Laboratory's "Digital Hangar," a concept created by Dr. Rick Graves, an aerospace research engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory's Design & Analysis Branch, part of AFRL's Aerospace Systems Directorate, is a virtual repository containing digital surrogates of aerospace systems that have been gated through rigorous validation and verification processes.
 One goal of the effort, Graves says, is to research and identify high-value data that need to be maintained, or curated, to produce an enduring set of digital artifacts for aerospace platforms that can be shared with other AFRL researchers, Air Force Service Program Offices, as well as other agencies such as NASA.
 Creation and curation of the Digital Hangar is part of a Department of Defense Digital Engineering initiative that began in June 2018 with the publication of a Digital Engineering Strategy that explains how DOD hopes to transform how the services design, develop, deliver, operate and sustain systems. To read the strategy, visit  https://www.acq.osd.mil/se/initiatives/init_de.html.
 The strategy defines digital engineering as an integrated digital approach that uses authoritative sources of system data and models as a continuum across disciplines to support lifecycle activities from concept through disposal.
 Graves, who grew up under the open skies of Oklahoma, used to dream about becoming an astronaut, though health issues ultimately prevented that from happening. He says he enjoys working at the lab where he interacts with other DOD civilian employees as well as scientists and engineers who wear the uniform. He said this is fulfilling since he was unable to wear the uniform.
 "I feel like I'm making a more direct contribution to the mission as we work together to deliver new technology faster to our warfighters," Graves said.
 AFRL's Digital Hangar fits into the mission of the Air Vehicle division where Graves works, which is to "discover, develop and deliver air vehicle technologies that revolutionize the capabilities of next-generation air vehicles and affordably sustain and enhance the fleet."
 "We have a lot of really bright and talented people who are looking at defining how AFRL is going to digitally transform to meet some of the design challenges that we're seeing going forward with many of our aerospace systems," Graves said.
 AFRL's Digital Hangar continues to be developed and will eventually house high-value design information for digital representations of Air Force aerospace systems that will inform decision-making within AFRL and other stakeholder organizations.
 The Digital Hangar is focused on the design and analysis phase of the acquisition life cycle, said Graves.
 "It's a lot cheaper to address problems or to look at physics-based questions through simulation as a project moves up the scale to ground testing or even a flight test, where it becomes more and more expensive."
 "We want to know what types of information we should be generating and using to make decisions during early design phases because that's where a lot of the costs for an aircraft get locked in. We want to know what types of information we should be gathering over the life cycle of the airplane. The idea is to identify what data is worth keeping, and reuse that data."
 It's a good idea to give decision makers the options to explore concept development through digital means rather than going all the way to flight tests, Graves said, adding, "To look at preliminary concepts in terms of transitioning technology is something we really like to look at as early as we can. This helps us transition our technology more efficiently."
 Graves said he and other researchers plan to add new aerospace systems to AFRL's Digital Hangar strategically, based on a set of rigorous validation and verification criteria.
 "We are taking a few candidate test cases and maturing those to see how it looks and is received. It really isn't just a digital description of a model – it's all the data that goes along with that model," Graves said.
 With a background in sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification, Graves says he has long had interests in data science, data engineering, and machine learning. As a graduate student, he was employed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, and was exposed to uncertainties associated with forecasting weather events. He hopes to apply these concepts and required skill sets to benefit AFRL.
 AFRL's Digital Hangar is an exciting area for young professionals who are interested in working for AFRL, according to Graves.
 "We are defining what the digital transformation for AFRL is going to look like in the next 10 years. This is a time for new ideas and new approaches," he said.
 "We are looking at an area where we as scientists and engineers are trying to get the people who are accepting the technology we are developing to embrace more risk. The organizations we deliver technology to may be risk adverse. You want to get them much more comfortable with the risk that you are taking to deliver them the technology that they really want. That requires a lot of communication between the two parties," Graves said.
 Graves' advice for people who may be interested in working at the lab: "Come to the lab and be prepared to take risks; you are going to make mistakes. Feel free to make mistakes and learn from them.
 "We bring students in and expose them to our modeling and simulation processes. Anyone who leaves our organization will have hands-on experience with developing the data that's associated with the models that might go in our Digital Hangar," Graves said.
 Lydia Pinsenschaum, the Digital Hangar's first curator, will be a senior this coming school year and enjoys participating in the Leadership, Experience, Growing Apprenticeships Committed to Youth, or LEGACY program, which began in November 2016. The program was created to spark student interest in science, technology, engineering and math and in turn become part of the Air Force workforce.
 Pinsenschaum, who is home schooled, has been working with Graves this summer to research digital curations organization benefits for the Digital Hangar as part of the LEGACY program, and said she has considered pursuing the aerospace engineering career field. She has a goal of attending the Air Force Academy with the ultimate goal of becoming a pilot.
 "This summer I've been learning about digital curation. I had never heard of it before, and now I know a whole lot more about it," she said.
 "For anyone that says, 'I want to go to the Air Force Academy; I think it's my job to help them get there because I wanted to go there when I was Lydia's age. Supporting this type of ambition is very important to me," Graves said.
 To close out her summer, Pinsenschaum delivered her final presentation to an audience of AFRL scientists and engineers, including AFRL Digital Engineering leadership led by Michael Hanke, director of AFRL's Research Collaboration and Computing Directorate. There have also been follow on requests for Pinsenschaum to brief other organizations at Wright-Patterson who are interested in digitally transforming.
 Her research findings will be presented at an upcoming Digital Engineering Working Group Meeting hosted by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense.

Regional supermarket chain H-E-B has beaten out Trader Joe's to be named America's top grocery store, according to a survey from data science firm dunnhumby.
The San Antonio-based company, which operates more than 400 stores in Texas and Mexico, topped dunnhumby's third annual Retailer Preference Index for U.S. grocery stores. The survey's top slot had previously been held by Trader Joe's for the last two years.
 The London-based dunnhumby surveyed 7,000 households across America to name the top 14 grocers in the U.S. based on seven metrics: price, quality, digital, operations, convenience, discounts or rewards and speed.
 "One of the most important findings is that leading traditional regional grocers are experiencing a resurgence in customer preference, by winning with relevance and convenience," Jose Gomes, president of North American for dunnhumby, said Wednesday in a news release. "In the end, there is no 'one size fits all' approach to winning in this market, and retailers with customer-first strategies are most likely to fare best."
 According to dunnhumby, the other grocers that made it into the top 14 in its survey were:
 2. Trader Joe's
 3. Amazon
 4. Market Basket
 5. Wegmans Food Markets
 6. Costco
 7. Aldi
 8. Sam's Club

Miami working to connect high school girls to STEM professionals

OXFORD —
The best way to get high school girls more interested in STEM careers is to get them together with women already established in the science, technology, engineering fields.
 That was the motivation behind Miami University's Careers Involving Quantitative Skills (CIQS) day earlier this week that saw more than 100 teenage girls from Butler County and Greater Cincinnati high schools on Miami's Oxford campus.
 The annual event is designed to expose female students to same-sex role models in STEM careers and among those teaching at Miami.
 The wide variety of informative and interactive sessions "introduces young women to all of the opportunities and careers opened by strong quantitative skills," said John Bailer, Miami University chair of the department of statistics.
 "Hands-on sessions are led by professionals from different sectors including water scientists from the Greater Cincinnati Water Works and Ohio EPA along with Miami faculty members from biology, geology, neuroscience, psychology, sports analytics and the Center for Analytics and Data Science," said Bailer.
 "Activities ranged from treating cloudy water to learning about facial recognition software to humanitarian mapping for disaster relief to neuroscience and learning," he said.
 Nationwide the efforts to expose more girls to STEM careers has been a stable of American K-12 education the last decade but results have been mixed.
 Locally, public school districts in Butler County have changed curricula in an attempt to include more STEM instructional practices they believe will capture the interests of girls.
 A 2019 survey by the national Junior Achievement organization finds a recent dip in the level of interest of girls toward possibly pursuing STEM careers.
 According to the Junior Achievement's website, "9 percent of girls between ages of 13 and 17 are interested in careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018."
 "The decline of interest in STEM careers is disappointing given how much emphasis is being placed on promoting STEM to girls," said Jack Kosakowski, president and CEO of Junior Achievement USA. "One element that may need to be emphasized more is ensuring that STEM professionals are serving as role models and working with girls in educational settings as part of these initiatives."
 That has been the goal of Miami's event and Emma Morrish, a sophomore at Talawanda High School, said it worked.
 "All the sessions were beneficial and it really helped to be with an adult in a possible future career I might be interested in," said Morrish.
 "This (event) helps because at your high school there may not be a person who has knowledge of a career. These events are important for young women because you don't necessarily thin of women being in these type of careers," she said.

A Colorado Springs company with a growing Dayton-area presence has been awarded nearly $190 million in new military contracts to strengthen Air Force capabilities in machine learning and space war-fighting.
As part of that contract, Apogee Engineering has won $135.9 million to begin work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from the Air Combat Command (ACC) Intelligence Directorate in data science, machine learning and other fields.
 The company is also working with the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) — which is based at Wright Patterson — Space Vehicles and Directed Energy directorates.
 MORE: VIDEO: Candidates for Dayton commission react to corruption investigation
 From a Beavercreek office at 4031 Col. Glenn Highway, Apogee will work with AFRL on creating technologies that support war-fighting capabilities in space, communications, positioning, navigation and other critical functions.
 Apogee is spread across 25 locations, with about 300 employees nationwide. One of its main satellite facilities is Beavercreek, where the business has about 30 employees, said Frank Varga, vice president, program operations at Apogee.

 It's no accident the office is close to Wright-Patterson, home not only to AFRL but also the Life Cycle Management Center and its program offices, Varga said.
 "Apogee is currently hiring the best and brightest in their fields," he said in an interview Thursday.
 Wright Patterson is on the leading edge of more than one next-generation Air Force technology, which means the Apogee local office should only grow, he said.
 The office has already grown consistently in the past five years, based on number of employees. Apogee has more than 40 openings now, not all in Beavercreek.
 Open positions include scientists and engineers who will work on cyber training, intelligence analysis and more. Most of that work is classified, Varga said.
 "Our support really centers around space research and technology and next-generation challenges, including both cyber-intel and what I would call 'space domain,'" he said.
 The company has served the base for about a decade now.
 Apogee has a "national campaign" to bring engineering talent to Dayton, Varga said, fueled by a compensation package he termed "exceptional."
 That campaign is going well, he said.
 "With unemployment at an all-time low, I think we've actually been really successful at relocating talent to the Dayton area," Varga said. "It's a great place to live, work and play, and when you couple that with the technological work that's being led by Wright-Patt, it's a pretty exciting place to be."
 Added Varga: "That's why we're here."
 He suspects growth will continue in Dayton and really all of the company's 25 operating locations.
 So far, Apogee has had no problem bringing talent to the Miami Valley.
 "We really do kind of sell the local 'live, work and play' (strengths) here, compared to other places nationally," Varga said. "When you couple that with the work activities, it really is a win-win for the area."
 Dayton's strengths include low cost of living, few traffic hassles, university presence and more, he said.

 Technology
   Leveraging the U.S. silicon manufacturing industry's expertise in rigid electronics and novel efforts in high-performance electronics 3D printing, a collaborative effort between the Air Force Research Laboratory and American Semiconductor has resulted in a new flexible, silicon-on-polymer chip that combines the best of the old and new to augment new networked realities.
   Experts at AFRL continue to expand the scope of their technological expertise, rising above the Earth's surface to meet the power needs of next-generation military spacecraft. A collaborative effort between AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing and Space Vehicles Directorates, the Space Industrial Base Working Group and SolAero Technologies has resulted in state-of-the art, multi-junction solar cells destined to reduce costs and increase power efficiency for military space applications.
   Natural or man-made disasters can result in large-scale catastrophes for vast populations, but through a technology licensing agreement with local innovators, AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate is looking to ease the burden and put bio-technology to use for humankind. When large groups of people are suddenly cut off from electricity, shelter and medical supplies, the initial crisis may be only the tip of the iceberg. Sanitation issues, disease and physical fatigue are among the many widespread and lingering problems that may arise from poor conditions. AFRL, along with Dayton-based innovators, S.A.Wyze (Situational Awareness Wisdom) hope to help alleviate this suffering with the help of ultra-stable antibody liquids.
   The U. S. School of Aerospace Medicine is the first research facility in the Department of Defense to use new Dynamic Athletic Research Institute 3D biomarkerless technology to predict injuries before they happen, allowing for intervention to prevent injuries and improve recovery rates. The DARI system looks at how a person is able to move his or her body while performing functional tasks and can predict where an injury might occur up to two weeks before it might happen.
   Materials Engineer Dr. Larry Brott of AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, led an effort to improve glow stick technology for use in military applications. More commonly referred to as "chemlights" in military circles, these handy devices can be used for a variety of applications. They can be used as a wand for directing vehicles or providing emergency lighting, or the fluid inside can be splashed onto a surface to mark routes or positions. The Materials and Manufacturing Directorate Technology Transfer office, led by Sunita Chavan, identified the researchers' work to the Technology Acceleration Project, or TAP. TAP is a pilot project of the Entrepreneurs Center, a Dayton-based technology incubator that seeks to bring together researchers and entrepreneurs who are interested in taking technologies to the next level.
   The Air Transportability Test Loading Activity, also known as ATTLA, of AFLCMC's Engineering Directorate, Crew Systems Branch, has a team of engineers representing a diverse variety of engineering specialties to certify all types of cargo for transport. They ensure cargo is safe for flight and is compatible with the capabilities of the plane. One of their projects has been NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, which is 100 times more powerful than the Hubble telescope and will allow astronomers to see deeper into the universe than ever before. The James Webb Space Telescope is slated to launch on an Ariane 5 rocket from a European launch complex located near Kourou, French Guiana, in 2019.
   Using a helium droplet method that chills molecular species to nearly absolute zero, researchers in AFRL's Aerospace Systems Directorate's Turbine Engine Division are able see carbon clusters, including soot precursors in combustion, in a completely new way – at record low temperatures [-272.78° C]. The C3 molecule is a soot precursor often found in flames, explosions and other combustion processes, as well as astronomical bodies, such as comets and stars. This discovery is key to improving a variety of models used in propulsion and space vehicle applications.
   Researchers at AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate are "turning up the heat" in the field of polymer additive manufacturing. In conjunction with researchers at NASA's Glenn Research Center and the University of Louisville, the team successfully printed the highest-temperature capable, reinforced polymer composite parts using additive manufacturing. Consisting of a high-temperature thermoset resin infused with carbon fiber filaments, this state-of-the-art material breakthrough sets the stage for next-generation, cost-efficient Air Force manufacturing needs.
   With support from the Air Force Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer Program, Ohio-based Frontier Technology Inc. produced a modeling and simulation capability to allow military operations planners to more realistically assess potential maintenance and logistics situations in combat. Also known as ISWAT – for Integrated Sustainment Wargaming Analysis Toolkit – this analytical model addresses the overall impact of sustainment systems on the Air Force's ability to conduct prolonged operations. Frontier Technology matured ISWAT with additional support from the Air Force SBIR/STTR Commercialization Readiness Program and the Air Force Rapid Innovation Fund so it could be used by AFMC.
   A collaborative effort between AFRL and industry partners through the Nano-Bio Manufacturing Consortium has led to the development of next-generation wearable patches that can detect electrolyte levels present in human sweat. Using novel AFRL-developed sensor materials and microfluidic technology, the patches can measure sodium and potassium levels present in sweat and transmit this information wirelessly for scientific analysis.
   Through a small business innovation research project with Luna Innovations Inc., scientists at AFRL and the Air Force Corrosion Prevention and Control Office supported the development of an improved system for coating materials performance evaluations that will accelerate the screening, qualification and implementation of new aircraft coatings. The new corrosion and coating evaluation system, CorRES, measures the ability of coatings to protect aircraft structures by using sensor panels that perform electrochemical measurements during corrosion testing. Unlike conventional coating tests that rely on an expert's visual evaluation of a test panel at the conclusion of a test cycle, CorRES records corrosion rate data throughout a test and transmits the data to a base station for evaluation. This enables researchers to know not only if a coating fails but exactly when this occurs during a test.
   Researchers from the Junior Force Warfighters Operations in AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate increased a pilot's capability to survive, escape and evade through near-term, short-turnaround projects. They worked to develop materials that will last longer in operational environments so that isolated personnel have the equipment readily available. A subteam of JFWORX, the Ejection Seat Survival Kit Enhancement, Modernization and Optimization team, worked to improve the current ejection seat survival kit for the Air Force. The kit contains more than 50 items.
   Using a process developed by Google called a Design Sprint, in less than one week's time, AFRL researchers defined, conceptualized and prototyped a new waterproof medical bag for the National Guard's 103rd Guardian Angel Personnel Recovery Unit, a team of medics trained in high sea personnel recovery. The project, code named "Med S.W.O.R.D." for "Medical Supply Waterproof Ocean Rescue Duffel," provided the Angels with quick-turn prototype solutions for a mission-critical need and gave the researchers a chance to test new ways of innovation and learning in the process.
   Although still in the research and development phase, a team of scientists and engineers in both AFRL and AFLCMC is working to complete a second-generation sensor package called the Real-Time Air Quality Sensor, or RTAQS, that will sense and assess cockpit air quality in real-time on high-performance aircraft during flight.
   Engineers from the AFRL's Manufacturing Technologies Division held a successful demonstration of the advanced capabilities of the Advanced Automation for Agile Aerospace Applications (A5) Robotic System at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. The 22,000-pound A5 robotic system is the first multi-purpose robot designed for use on the aerospace factory floor capable of using real-time sensor feedback to conduct work in a localized environment. By capitalizing on advancements in man-machine interfacing technologies, the A5 robot is anticipated to cut depot maintenance times for aircraft coating removal up to 50 percent, saving time and money over the lifecycle of a platform.
   AFRL is making it easier than ever for entrepreneurs to turn vision into reality with Express Technology Licensing. The groundbreaking effort is a new approach to moving AFRL laboratory technologies into the commercial sector. Through Express Licensing, innovators and entrepreneurs can simply visit a website and discover AFRL-developed technologies that are available for license, learn more about them, and quickly and easily determine if a licensing opportunity fits their capabilities.
   To provide junior military engineers with hands-on experience solving engineering challenges impacting the Department of Defense and the Air Force, AFLCMC created a pilot program called the Junior Engineer Development Initiative or JEDI. The idea for the initiative came from Maj. Richard Hanberg, an aerospace engineer in the F-22 Program Office, who was inspired after touring the Rapid Development Integration Facility on base. The RDIF, which is part of the Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Special Operations Force Directorate, is a 20,000-square-foot manufacturing and modification facility, which started as an organization that quickly modified aircraft and weapon systems to meet special operator needs and timelines. It has evolved to where it quickly designs and manufactures mechanical and electrical solutions to include modifications for military aircraft and weapons systems around the world.
   Computer use at Wright-Patterson AFB migrated from the AFNET into the "Cloud" under a directive by Air Force Space Command to better align resources and to outsource services, like email, under the Air Force Cloud Hosted Enterprise Services Program. Users also received a second cloud-based service, Skype for Business.
   A research project intended to enable more precise imaging of space objects moved from lab bench testing to field testing at the John Bryan State Park observatory, illuminating night skies with a green laser beam of light. The project was a collaboration between the Electro-Optical Space Situational Awareness Team of AFRL's Sensors Directorate and AFIT's Department of Engineering Physics. Analyzing these measurements will provide scientists with valuable information when imaging objects in space.
   Researchers at AFRL are doing their part to make the next Mars rover mission an astronomical success. At the request of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and project partners, AFRL concluded a series of tests in the Particle Erosion Test Facility, located in the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate's Coatings, Corrosion and Erosion Laboratory. For this effort, AFRL experts evaluated the effects of dust, particulates, and small rocks on the protective surface coatings of the Mars 2020 rover vehicle.
   The Junior Force Warfighters Operations in AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate hope to patent a new and improved "milk stool" for the C-130 aircraft. The milk stool is a wooden support placed under the rear loading ramp of a C-130 aircraft for stability during heavy loading operations. The project seeks to cut costs and prevent injuries to Airmen.
   Nine teams of scientists and engineers from AFRL joined other top innovators and creative minds from around the country at the AFWERX Fusion Xperience, June 20-21 in Las Vegas to highlight technology ideas designed to identify innovative solutions to enhance Air Force areas of focus. AFWERX was established in 2017 by the secretary of the Air Force and is a catalyst for agile Air Force engagement across industry, academia and non-traditional contributors to create transformative opportunities and foster an Air Force culture of innovation.
   A Dayton, Ohio, start-up company accelerated the research and development process by leveraging Air Force and Ohio State Highway Patrol training exercises to gather information from potential users. Battle Sight Technologies LLC, or BST LLC, was one of nearly a dozen companies that participated in tech warrior operations in April at the National Center for Medical Readiness, a Wright State Research Institute Laboratory. The event is part of the new Tech Warrior Enterprise, which is sponsored by the Air Force Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer Program, and places developing technologies into the hands of warfighters for evaluation and feedback.
   A Reserve Citizen Airman at Wright-Patterson AFB is working to help create an algorithm to predict the outbreak of radicalized violence in Ukraine. 655th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group Reserve Citizen Airman Tech. Sgt. Clark (first name withheld), an analyst with the 49th Intelligence Squadron, is impacting an international security analysis program. Clark is combining deep linguistic expertise with cutting-edge data science to build a Ukrainian-English urban phrase "exonym" dictionary for the Coalition for Open-Source Defense Analysis (CODA) to use in creating an algorithm to predict the outbreak of radicalized violence in Ukraine. Exonyms are social responses, or hostile group-level references to an opposing group, created by combining terms to create a derogatory expression. These expressions mark the use of language as an ideological weapon with the goal to mock, diminish and/or dehumanize opponents.
   Thanks to upgrades and a team of AFRL experts, a new laboratory capability is filling a much-needed role in materials durability testing for the military and beyond. The Materials and Manufacturing Directorate's Supersonic Rain Erosion Test Facility, or SuRE, answers a vital need for some of today's most advanced aeronautical and mechanical systems. This highly specialized apparatus allows scientists to evaluate materials and coatings durability by directing a variable spray of water at test specimens, subjecting them to conditions simulating real-world rain and weather events. The specimens are then evaluated by AFRL specialists who determine the effect of the high-force spray on the materials and can provide expert analysis and recommendations.
   AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate and Ohio State University's Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis have a congressionally directed collaborative research agreement in the works. The agreement pushes the limits of advanced characterization techniques over a wide range of material classes and fosters long-standing research collaboration between OSU's CEMAS and the directorate. The program will contribute to a multitude of research topics aligned directly to respective research teams within the directorate. The idea is to explore a wide range of structural, functional and/or biological materials in innovative ways, providing innovative solutions to promote the warfighter advantage.
   AFRL is developing an innovative new tool to manage aircraft corrosion more effectively. Researchers from Materials and Manufacturing Directorate are developing and testing a device that could help pre-emptively predict corrosive environmental conditions before they can start causing damage to valuable assets. Called the WISE-MP, which stands for Weather Instrumentation and Specialized Environmental Monitoring Platform, the device can measure conditions that can be detrimental to aircraft, such as pollutants, salt and moisture. The prototype device, which consists of a gas monitor, weather sensor, chloride monitor and control box mounted on a sturdy aluminum frame, occupies a small footprint. It is portable, durable and waterproof with easy access to components. The platform is low-maintenance, requiring only occasional filter changes and minor adjustments.
   Researchers at AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate developed a way to make aircraft maintainers' lives easier by using augmented reality to simplify and expedite nondestructive inspection. NDI is the inspection of materials or structures to detect flaws or other undesired conditions without causing unwanted damage.
   AFRL's Small Business Office awarded $100,000 to a team from the 711th Human Performance Wing to further enhance wearable monitoring devices designed for survival training exercises. Team members from the 711 HPW completed initial design and software development activities in response to an Innovation Pipeline program called the AFRL Challenge. The Survival Health Awareness Responders Kit, or SHARK, team far exceeded the challenge by conducting field tests with end users. Team members traveled to Camp Bullis near San Antonio and lived with Air Force instructors in tents to test the monitoring devices on students.
   AFRL's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate completed an extensive effort to help certify a maintenance process that could extend the life of aircraft hydraulic system components. Through participation in a rapid innovation fund team led by AFLCMC, AFRL researchers helped develop, test and validate a cold spray coating process for the life extension of aircraft hydraulic lines. Cold spray is a technique by which metal particles are accelerated onto a surface through high-pressure application. The force of the impact bonds the metal to the surface without the need for temperatures as high as those typically associated with other deposition processes. This process was identified as a potential solution for replacement B-1 aircraft hydraulic lines, which are prone to chafing damage.
   An 11-member Mobile Application Development Team with AFLCMC's Business and Enterprise Systems Directorate recently developed its first organic mobile application prototype and presented it to Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Heather Wilson during the Air Force Information Technology Conference in Montgomery, Alabama, in August. The team, all of whom are active-duty with varying levels of software development knowledge and experience, was pulled together on short notice. In fewer than 42 days, they were able to create the Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S) app. With a focus on operational effectiveness, the app, if fielded, could allow maintenance personnel on the flightline to check the quantity, location and order status of aircraft parts as well as issue orders for parts needed for the aircraft. Potential benefits include improving efficiency on the flightline by reducing the number of hours maintainers spend requesting parts.
   More than 30 companies from around the country tested innovations during Operation Tech Warrior, a technology acceleration event sponsored by the Air Force Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer Program. Held in September at the National Center for Medical Readiness – a Wright State Research Institute Laboratory in Fairborn, Ohio – the event is part of an expanded Tech Warrior Enterprise. The idea behind the Tech Warrior Enterprise, which combines training exercises with fledgling technology, is to accelerate critical tools and solutions developed by small businesses to the warfighter. For small businesses, it provides a proving ground and fosters long-term relationships with potential end-user groups to better posture technology for commercialization and transitions. A wide range of technologies were integrated into training missions at Operation Tech Warrior. Many trainees were subject matter experts from AFRL, who would not normally get an opportunity to see how technology performs in combat. The instructors, comprised of warfighters with a myriad of combat deployment experience, also provided critical feedback to business participants.
   AFMC's Contracting Directorate launched a new podcast, "The Contracting Experience," to educate and inform government professionals across the globe on relevant, timely topics related to the field. It provides listeners insight into evolving issues, high-performance leadership and lessons from the field through conversations with acquisition influencers and contracting leaders, in an easy-to-listen format available on demand.
   Due in part to the relationship between the Air Force and NASA as well as the location and unique capabilities of the Defense Department's only human-rated centrifuge, 10 astronauts underwent two days of testing at AFRL's 711 HPW Nov. 1. The AFRL-NASA discussion began in August, which is when engineers from both teams began working to transform the centrifuge, more commonly used for fast-jet pilot training, into a system for astronaut testing.
   Ingenuity and collaboration were the keys to success as a group of AFRL engineers took a series of tests to new heights. At the request of NASA, AFRL rapid-response Systems Support researchers delved into the realm of space to help determine the effects of unintended electrical arcing on astronaut space suits during extravehicular maintenance.
 Readiness & Training
   The 88 MDG Simulation Center held an open house Jan. 26 to showcase its new location, expanded services and equipment that will improve and enhance training for medical professionals at Wright-Patterson AFB. The center offers training for medical professionals in a realistic setting, allowing them to assess, treat and monitor simulated patients.
   Teamwork, the commitment of Airmen and ongoing observations of command processes were among the highlights of an exercise that concluded throughout AFMC Feb. 2. A series of AFMC-wide training scenarios had the goal of ensuring the command can execute its responsibilities in support of the Air Force mission to fly, fight and win in all operational situations.
   To foster communication within the training community, AFLCMC's Simulator Program Office and the National Training and Simulation Association co-hosted a simulation and training forum May 8. The one-day event brought together acquisition experts, operating commands and industry partners for discussions about the simulation and training field.
   USAFSAM began offering Air Force Medical Service mid-level leaders a new Basic Leader Airman Skills Training course to empower the total force with the skills needed to provide safe, high-quality, patient-centered care beginning Oct. 1. BLAST is a five-day course that provides managerial and administrative training, including Trusted Care principles, for flight commanders, flight chiefs and medical directors from all seven AFMS corps – biomedical sciences, dental, medical, medical services, nurse, enlisted and civilian – for those currently in a position, slated to occupy a position or as preparation for a possible opportunity.
   AFLCMC kicked off a new leadership development program for high-performing mid-level employees from across the center. The Strategic Acquisition Leadership Team, or SALT, was developed to help employees who have or will soon transition from technical experts into leadership positions. SALT participants worked to solve real-world acquisition challenges facing their own organizations and experienced more than 65 hours of academic curriculum, including learning from professionals from the University of Dayton as well as Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute. The team also participated in weekly briefings to senior leaders, multiple workshops and a trip to Washington, D.C.
   A first-of-its-kind training exercise held at Wright-Patterson AFB's fire training facility Sept. 28 brought together the Wright-Patterson AFB Fire Department, part of the 788th Civil Engineer Squadron; additional base personnel; fire personnel from mutual aid partners Beavercreek Twp., Xenia and Fairborn; and local dignitaries and elected decision-makers. The event, "Fire Ops 101," saw dozens of people suiting up in personal protective gear to experience various scenarios of what firefighters and emergency response personnel experience as they protect people and property.
   A two-year pilot program to test strategies to improve the Air Force civilian hiring process began Oct. 28. Air Force Personnel Center Operating Locations at Hill, Robins, Tinker and Wright-Patterson AFBs that provide AFMC personnel support will realign to AFMC, creating opportunities to test innovative strategies for processing of civilian personnel actions. The goal is to improve civilian hiring timeliness and throughput across the Air Force.
   Dozens of employees at Wright-Patterson AFB started changing their work and private lives Oct. 31 when the Team Wright-Patt Mentoring Program held its latest kickoff. The fiscal 2019 program participants include active-duty service members and civilians and are drawn from all base organizations. The program is aligned with the principles and goals outlined by AFMAN 36-2643, the Air Force Mentoring Program.
 Funding & Saving Initiatives
   AFRL's Advanced Power Technology Office collaborated with Dover AFB Airmen and private companies Jan. 30 on programs to make the entire C-17 Globemaster III fleet lighter, safer and more fuel efficient. Three programs currently being developed by APTO to improve the C-17 fleet include the installation of microvanes, the use of synthetic tie-downs instead of cargo chains and the use of winch cables instead of steel cables.
   The Wright-Patterson AFB Recycling Center continued to lower waste and generate income by diverting 41 percent of municipal solid waste from landfills while reducing the base's environmental footprint. The center has a full-service metals yard that takes scrap metal and improves it by separating ferrous and non-ferrous materials to get the maximum price for those commodities.
   A diverse group of senior leaders from all Department of Defense agencies met at Wright-Patterson AFB Aug. 22 to learn more about progress the Air Force Installation Contracting Agency has made in reducing total cost of common items. The initiative, known as Category Management, takes a disciplined, data-driven, strategic cost management approach to eliminate redundancies, increase efficacy and effectiveness and deliver more value and savings to the warfighter. This meeting was the second hosted by AFICA to demonstrate the progress the Air Force has made in Category Management.
   October, Energy Action Month, provided an opportunity for Airmen at Wright-Patterson AFB to learn more about the impact of energy to the Air Force's mission. The intent of EAM is to give the Air Force as a whole an assured energy advantage by challenging each individual and agency to support protecting power in everyday activities. Organizations also looked at mission processes to find larger efficiencies that supported this initiative. The goal was to inspire the total force to be more efficient so they give the Air Force an assured energy advantage in air, space and cyberspace.
   The 88th Communications Squadron cable team completed a four-year, self-help project that will improve performance and eliminate potential outages. The team designed, engineered and implemented the relocation of an intermediate distribution frame from an old, nonenvironmentally controlled facility, called a cross connect hut, in Bldg. 840 where the 711 HPW is headquartered. The project provided the recycling center and base community with more than $36,000 of copper for recycling. By doing the work in-house, the Air Force was saved more than $750,000 in labor costs.

Butler County hoping to get back $620K it was forced to return to the state

BUTLER COUNTY —
Butler County's new land bank chief is confident it won't lose more federal blight-busting dollars and she is seeking to expand the grant-eligible footprint to jurisdictions outside Hamilton and Middletown to recoup $620,000 that was lost last year.
 The land bank missed a mid-December deadline to spend $3.2 million demolishing eyesores. A surge in property acquisitions by Middletown will consume 60 to 65 percent of the remaining $1 million in funds.
 The program reimbursed Hamilton for acquisition and demolition of 153 properties, while Middletown was reimbursed for 44 and Fairfield Twp. was reimbursed for four.
 County Treasurer Nancy Nix, who serves as president of the land bank, said the county can compete to recoup the lost funds. Middletown City Manager Doug Adkins told the Journal-News his city has been razing ramshackle homes according to the city council's direction, as part of a plan they are developing to transform the city's housing stock.
 "The vacant, blighted houses in those neighborhoods are mostly down. The remaining blight in those grant-eligible neighborhoods is with occupied houses, which are not eligible under this grant," Adkins told the Journal-News. "I fully understand the county's and the land bank's concerns in returning grant funds, but Middletown only had so many qualifying properties to work with."
 When asked if the city would participate in trying to get some of the money back, Adkins replied, "Given our ongoing housing policy discussions, it would be premature to open up demolition to other areas."
 Adkins described the city's housing problem to the land bank board a little over a year ago saying the city "shot itself in the foot" when it significantly increased Section 8 housing in the late 1990s. He said the city has too many vacant houses, too many functionally obsolete houses that people don't want to live in and too many landlords not properly maintaining properties.
 Commissioner Don Dixon said he understands Middletown has different needs and those do not necessarily fit the mold of the grant. Going forward, he said he hopes they can utilize all the funds they can get county-wide, including other communities.
 "We'll see how much Middletown thinks they can use in their program and we'll try to redirect the rest," he said. "We'll reach out to the rest of the county and see if we can't use it there."
 MORE: Butler blight-busting agency approves spending more local funds
 Membership in the land bank includes: Fairfield, Hamilton, Middletown, New Miami, Seven Mile, Trenton and Fairfield, Hanover, Lemon, Liberty, Madison, Oxford, Ross, St. Clair and Wayne township.
 A 500 percent leap from about 500 to 3,000 foreclosures between 1999 and 2010 prompted the establishment of the land bank in 2012. There was also state money available that the cities of Hamilton and Middletown wanted to tap into. In the beginning, only the two largest cities were members of the land bank.
 Two years later, Butler County commissioners agreed to use other funds to bolster the land bank, help raise the required matching funds and open up services for the entire county. For the first two years, only the cities of Hamilton and Middletown benefited from state and federal programs designed to beat back blight.
 As of last July, the land bank has razed about 382 eyesores in Hamilton and 277 in Middletown at a cost of $7.3 million, most paid for with state and federal funds.
 Former land bank leader Mike McNamara sought the help of Miami University students in the Center for Analytics & Data Science a couple years ago, to try to determine whether bringing down blight is achieving the goal of stabilizing neighborhoods. The students found property values of homes within a 500-foot radius of a downed eyesore increased 29.65 percent in Hamilton but a "statistically insignificant" amount in Middletown.
 Meanwhile, banishing blight in Middletown had a positive effect on foreclosures but the results were not true for Hamilton.
 "Interestingly, in Middletown, there is a strong association between blight removal and foreclosures," the students wrote. "Such that proximity to a demolished property is associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of foreclosure when comparing similar properties."

How educated are Butler and Warren counties? Officials are giving new attention to that question

BUTLER COUNTY —
To keep up with workforce demand, 65 percent of Ohio's working-age adults need to have a college degree or some type of advanced training by 2025, officials said.
 But with six years remaining, the state is 21 percent away from that target.
 Jobs in the Miami Valley and around the state are becoming more technical and skilled in nature, said Rick Pearce, president of The Chamber of Commerce Serving Middletown, Monroe and Trenton. Even the manufacturing industry, which has historically been open to anyone, needs workers with the training to operate increasingly more complicated and computerized machinery, he said.
 "Continuing education is the key," Pearce said. "A high school education is not enough. You need some type of training after high school to be competitive."
 Around 44.1 percent of Ohio's 6 million or so residents aged 25- to 64 have a college degree, certificate or training in a skilled trade, according to the Ohio Department of Higher Education. That's up nine percentage points from a little over a decade ago but still far off from the 2025 goal set by the Ohio Department of Higher Education.
 The need to boost degrees, credentials and training has led to several statewide and national efforts in recent years.
 The state legislature in 2017 passed a law requiring ODHE to track and release an annual report on Ohio's degree, credential and training rate. Last year, the state's public universities launched a campaign called Forward Ohio that aims to increase attention, opportunities and funding for four-year schools.
 Ohio is three points behind the United States as a whole, which has just under 47 percent of citizens with a post-secondary education, according to the state. There are 32 states where the rate of college degrees, credentials or training is higher than Ohio's.
 Warren County has one of the highest rates in the state at 53.5 percent for 25- to 64-year-olds with a college education. Butler County's percentage is 39.7 and Preble County's is 24.9, the second lowest in the region.
 The Chamber has analyzed the five-year forecast for jobs in demand in Butler and Warren counties, as it relates to members and large manufacturers, Pearce said. The top five jobs: Customer service representatives, registered nurses, insurance sales agents, bank tellers and heavy and tractor-trailers truck drivers.
 Pearce said research shows that "a good job" is considered a position that pays $35,000 a year, or $17 an hour for full-time, for those under the age of 45 and $45,000, or $22 an hour, for workers older than 45. There was a time, Pearce said, many of those "good jobs" without a bachelor's degree were in manufacturing. But those jobs are declining while jobs in skilled-services industries, such as health services and financial services, are increasing.
 "If you don't know what you want to do, there are other options," he said. "College is expensive."
 Pearce believes high school graduates need to ask themselves: What am I good at and what do I enjoy doing? Match those talents with your profession, he said.
 Mimi Sylva, director of Cincinnati State Middletown, is working with the Chamber to offer programs that match the needs of the local workforce. For instance, Cincinnati State hopes to offer a banking certificate, then encourage the students to obtain more education and "move up the ranks," she said.
 Sylva said there was a time when high school graduates either went to college or entered the workforce, one or the other. But now, Sylva said, high school graduates can start working and attend school, either online or at night, at the same time. She said employers can offer employees education reimbursement and that's a "very attractive carrot" to recruit potential workers.
 Also at Cincinnati State, the goal is to provide students "short-term training," Sylva said.
 "The jobs are now," she said.
 Cathy Bishop-Clark, associate provost and dean of Miami University Regionals, said Ohio is asking the regional campuses of Ohio's public universities to offer relevant applied bachelor's degree programs to help meet the needs of Ohio's "current and future workforce."
 That is exactly what Miami Regionals is doing, she said. U.S. News & World Report, in its 2019 Best Colleges edition, published a story about the "eight hot majors with a bright future." The list included: mechatronics engineering, business, computer science, data science, cognitive science, nursing, pharmaceutical sciences and human resources.
 She said Miami University Regionals offer the first six on the list.
 Bishop-Clark said Miami Regionals consult on a regular basis with businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and chambers of commerce in their communities to ensure they're offering what local workforce needs now and in the future.
 AJ Huff, public relations coordinator at Butler Tech, said the school works closely with dozens on businesses to ensure its students are provided job shadowing opportunities, manufacturing tours, apprentice days and roundtable discussions with a 36-member business advisory board.
 It's all about matching students with their passion, Huff said. College isn't the answer for every student, she said.
 "The perception is changing," she said.
 In the last few years, Ohio has changed its funding model to encourage completion. Colleges that are able to graduate more students now receive more state financial support.
 Among other efforts, the state has tried to bolster completion by encouraging students to take College Credit Plus courses, which are free for high schoolers to take. College Credit Plus allows students to take college courses to earn credit before graduating from high school.
 By the Numbers
 53.3%: Rate of 25- to 64-year-olds with college degrees, training or credentials in Warren County in 2018

Two artificial intelligence programs created by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Microsoft beat humans on a Stanford University reading comprehension test, Alibaba announced. The Chinese government has outlined a plan to create a $150 billion AI industry by 2030 in partnership with private companies such as Alibaba and Tencent.
First, they beat us at chess. Then it was Go. Now it's basic reading comprehension.
The robots are coming.
Two artificial intelligence programs created by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Microsoft beat humans on a Stanford University reading comprehension test, Alibaba said recently. Alibaba took the honors as creator of the first program to ever beat a human in a reading comprehension test, scoring 82.44 percent out of a perfect 100 and narrowly edging past the human's 82.304 percent.
A different program built by Microsoft scored higher than Alibaba's at 82.605 on the same test, but that score was finalized a day later, according to Bloomberg.
The test, known as Stanford Question Answering Dataset or SQuAD for short, asks contestants - human and robot - to provide exact answers to more than 100,000 questions drawn from more than 500 Wikipedia articles. The test is designed to see if artificial intelligence can process large amounts of information before fully comprehending it and offering precise answers.
Some of the Wikipedia articles from which questions were drawn covered a wide range of topics, from Super Bowl 50 ("Where did Super Bowl 50 take place?" Answer: Santa Clara.) to Doctor Who ("What planet is Doctor Who from?" Answer: Gallifrey.).
"These kinds of tests are certainly useful benchmarks for how far along the AI journey we may be," Microsoft spokesperson Andrew Pickup told CNN. "However, the real benefit of AI is when it is used in harmony with humans."
Major technology companies in the United States and China have invested billions of dollars in artificial intelligence to gain a foothold in what may be the next technological frontier. The Chinese government has outlined a plan to create a $150 billion AI industry by 2030 in partnership with private companies such as Alibaba and Tencent.
Microsoft in December announced its "AI on Earth" project to help the planet become more environmentally sustainable using the company's in-house AI infrastructure. Microsoft will invest $50 million over the next five years, according to Microsoft CEO Brad Smith.
"At Microsoft, we believe artificial intelligence is a game changer," said Smith. "As we enter the world's Fourth Industrial Revolution, a technology-fueled transformation, we must not only move technology forward, but also use this era's technology to clean up the past and create a better future."
With comprehension skills now arguably better than a human's, Alibaba's chief data scientist said the new breakthrough will be applied to helping human customers.
"The technology underneath can be gradually applied to numerous applications such as customer service, museum tutorials and online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the need for human input in an unprecedented way," Luo Si, chief scientist for natural language processing at Alibaba's Institute of Data Science of Technologies, told Bloomberg.

Bannon connected to data collection; Former Cambridge Analytica employee says he oversaw its program

More than three years before he served as Trump's chief political strategist, Stephen K. Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the financial backing of the Mercer family.
Conservative strategist Stephen K. Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica's early efforts to collect troves of Facebook data as part of an ambitious program to build detailed profiles of millions of American voters, a former employee of the data-science firm said Tuesday.
The 2014 effort was part of a high-tech form of voter persuasion touted by the company, which under Bannon identified and tested the power of anti-establishment messages that later would emerge as central themes in President Trump's campaign speeches, according to Chris Wylie, who left the company at the end of that year.
Among the messages tested were "drain the swamp" and "deep state," he said.
Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Trump's 2016 campaign, is now facing questions about alleged unethical practices, including charges that the firm improperly handled the data of tens of millions of Facebook users. On Tuesday, the company's board announced that it was suspending its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after British television released secret recordings that appeared to show him talking about entrapping political opponents.
More than three years before he served as Trump's chief political strategist, Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the financial backing of the wealthy Mercer family as part of a broader effort to create a populist power base. Earlier this year, the Mercers cut ties with Bannon after he was quoted making incendiary comments about Trump and his family.
In an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post at his lawyer's London office, Wylie said that Bannon - while he was a top executive at Cambridge Analytica and head of Breitbart News - was deeply involved in the company's strategy and approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014.
"We had to get Bannon to approve everything at this point. Bannon was Alexander Nix's boss," said Wylie, who was Cambridge Analytica's research director. "Alexander Nix didn't have the authority to spend that much money without approval."
Bannon, who served on the company's board, did not respond to a request for comment. He served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica from June 2014 to August 2016, when he became chief executive of Trump's campaign, according to his publicly filed financial disclosure. In 2017, he joined Trump in the White House as his chief strategist.
Bannon received more than $125,000 in consulting fees from Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and owned "membership units" in the company worth between $1 million and $5 million, according to his financial disclosure.
Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment about Bannon's role.
It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the data, which allegedly was collected through an app that was portrayed as a tool for psychological research but was then transferred to the company.
Facebook has said that information was improperly shared and that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica officials said that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.
Wylie said that both Bannon and Rebekah Mercer, whose father, Robert Mercer, financed the company, participated in conference calls in 2014 in which plans to collect Facebook data were discussed, although Wylie acknowledged that it was not clear they knew the details of how the collection took place.
Bannon "approved the data-collection scheme we were proposing," Wylie said.
The Mercers did not respond to a request for comment.
The data and analyses that Cambridge Analytica generated in this time provided discoveries that would later form the emotionally charged core of Trump's presidential platform, said Wylie, whose disclosures in news reports over the past several days have rocked both his onetime employer and Facebook.
"Trump wasn't in our consciousness at that moment; this was well before he became a thing," Wylie said. "He wasn't a client or anything."
The year before Trump announced his presidential bid, the data firm already had found a high level of alienation among young, white Americans with a conservative bent.
Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, shown in 2016, was suspended from the company last week.
In focus groups arranged to test messages for the 2014 midterms, these voters responded to calls for building a new wall to block the entry of illegal immigrants, to reforms intended to "drain the swamp" of Washington's entrenched political community and to thinly veiled forms of racism toward African Americans called "race realism," he recounted.
The firm also tested views of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The only foreign thing we tested was Putin," he said. "It turns out, there's a lot of Americans who really like this idea of a really strong authoritarian leader and people were quite defensive in focus groups of Putin's invasion of Crimea."
The controversy over Cambridge Analytica's data collection erupted in recent days amid news reports that an app created by a Cambridge University psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, accessed extensive personal data of 50 million Facebook users. The app, called thisisyourdigitallife, was downloaded by 270,000 users. Facebook's policy, which has since changed, allowed Kogan to also collect data - including names, home towns, religious affiliations and likes - on all of the Face-book "friends" of those users. Kogan shared that data with Cambridge Analytica for its growing database on American voters.
Facebook on Friday banned the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie for improperly sharing that data.
The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook to determine whether the social media platform violated a 2011 consent decree governing its privacy policies when it allowed the data collection. And Wylie plans to testify to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee as part of their investigation of Russian interference in the election, including possible ties to the Trump campaign.
Meanwhile, Britain's Channel 4 News aired a video Tuesday in which Nix was shown boasting about his work for Trump. He seemed to highlight his firm's secrecy, at one point stressing the need to set up a special email account that self-destructs all messages so that "there's no evidence, there's no paper trail, there's nothing."
The company said in a statement that Nix's comments "do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation."
Nix could not be reached for comment.
Cambridge Analytica was set up as a U.S. affiliate of British-based SCL Group, which had a wide range of governmental clients globally, in addition to its political work. Wylie said that Bannon and Nix first met in 2013, the same year that Wylie - a young data whiz with some political experience in Britain and Canada - was working for SCL Group. Bannon and Wylie met soon after and hit it off in conversations about culture, elections and how to spread ideas using technology.
Bannon, Wylie, Nix, Rebekah Mercer and Robert Mercer met in Rebekah Mercer's Manhattan apartment in the fall of 2013, striking a deal in which Robert Mercer would fund the creation of Cambridge Analytica with $10 million, with the hope of shaping the congressional elections a year later, according to Wylie. Robert Mercer, in particular, seemed transfixed by the group's plans to harness and analyze data, he recalled.
The Mercers were keen to create a U.S.-based business to avoid bad optics and violating U.S. campaign finance rules, Wylie said. "They wanted to create an American brand," he said.
The young company struggled to quickly deliver on its promises, Wylie said. Widely available information from commercial data brokers provided people's names, addresses, shopping habits and more, but failed to distinguish on more fine-grained matters of personalitythat might affect political views.
Cambridge Analytica initially worked for 2016 Republican candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who was backed by the Mercers. The Trump campaign had rejected early overtures to hire Cambridge Analytica, and Trump himself said in May 2016 that he "always felt" that the use of voter data was "overrated."
After Cruz faded, the Mercers switched their allegiance to Trump and pitched their services to Trump's digital director, Brad Parscale. The company's hiring was approved by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was informally helping to manage the campaign with a focus on digital strategy.
Kushner said in an interview with Forbes magazine that the campaign "found that Face-book and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. . . . We brought in Cambridge Analytica." Kushner said he "built" a data hub for the campaign "which nobody knew about, until towards the end."
Kushner's spokesman and lawyer both declined to comment Tuesday.
Two weeks before Election Day, Nix told a Post reporter at the company's New York City office that his company could "determine the personality of every single adult in the United States of America."
The claim was widely questioned, and the Trump campaign later said that it didn't rely on psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica. Instead, the campaign said that it used a variety of other digital information to identify probable supporters.
Parscale said in a Post interview in October 2016 that he had not "opened the hood" on Cambridge Analytica's methodology, and said he got much of his data from the Republican National Committee. Parscale declined to comment Tuesday. He has previously said that the Trump campaign did not use any psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica.
Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL Group, has an ongoing contract with the State Department's Global Engagement Center. The company was paid almost $500,000 to interview people overseas to understand the mindset of Islamist militants as part of an effort to counter their online propaganda and block recruits.
Heather Nauert, the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, said Tuesday that the contract was signed in November 2016, under the Obama administration, and has not expired yet. In public records, the contract is dated in February 2017, and the reason for the discrepancy was not clear. Nauert said that the State Department had signed other contracts with SCL Group in the past.

An elite team of computer scientists and medical experts from Google and three major U.S. universities believe they've found a better way yet to predict outcomes for hospitalized patients.
Dr. Google might not have much of a bedside manner - she's an algorithm, after all - but if she says you're soon to be "expired," she claims to be about 95 percent accurate, and you might want to start planning that last meal.
An elite team of computer scientists and medical experts from Google and three major U.S. universities believe they've found the best way yet to predict whether a hospitalized patient will end up leaving via the front doors or the loading dock at the morgue.
As might be expected from research led by Google, the software for accomplishing this task relies on artificial intelligence, which has become a key focus in virtually all areas of the Mountain View company's operations.
In a recently released paper, which was not peer reviewed, the researchers claim their AI-based software, based on AI known as "deep learning," does a better job at predicting patient outcomes than other methods currently available.
"These models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all cases," the paper said.
To make its predictions, the software uses medical-records data including patient demographics, previous diagnoses and procedures, lab results and vital signs.
Top of the list of outcomes predicted is "inpatient mortality," in which the patient is reported as "expired."
But the software goes beyond the question of life and death, to answer questions important to patients as well as hospital administrators and bean counters. Unplanned readmissions to the medical facility within 30 days are also covered, as well as probable length of stay and diagnoses, the latter of which is delineated using hospital billing codes.
The paper covered the study of some 216,000 hospitalizations involving about 114,000 patients - anonymous to the researchers - at two hospitals: UC San Francisco and the University of Chicago.
"Its biggest claim is the ability to predict patient deaths 24-48 hours before current methods, which could allow time for doctors to administer life-saving procedures," according to online magazine Quartz, which spotted the paper published Jan. 26.
The software was able to predict death, at 24 hours after admission, with 93 percent to 95 percent accuracy, about 10 percent better than the traditional predictive method, according to the paper.
The researchers admitted to various limitations in their work, noting, for example, that it's not a "foregone conclusion" that accurate predictions can improve care.
Among the science stars on the 35-researcher team were Google senior fellow Jeff Dean, head of the AI-focused "Google Brain" project; Stanford Neurosciences Institute professor Nigam Shah; and Alvin Rajkomar, director of clinical data science at UC San Francisco's Center for Digital Health Innovation.

655th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group Reserve Citizen Airman Tech. Sgt. Clark (first name withheld), an analyst with the 49th Intelligence Squadron, is impacting an international security analysis program.
Clark is combining deep linguistic expertise with cutting-edge data science to build a Ukrainian-English urban phrase "exonym" dictionary for the Coalition for Open-Source Defense Analysis (CODA) to use in creating an algorithm to predict the outbreak of radicalized violence in Ukraine.
 https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/sweet-lessons-70th-anniversary-the-berlin-airlift/rgr1kMmvcvACfan0agBSFN/
 Exonyms are social responses, or hostile group-level references to an opposing group, created by combining terms to create a derogatory expression. These expressions mark the use of language as an ideological weapon with the goal to mock, diminish and/or dehumanize opponents. They are being studied by two graduate students at the Naval Post-graduate School, Monterey, California, under Dr. T. Camber Warren, professor in the Department of Defense Analysis and CODA director.
 "This project is an effort to use millions of geo-referenced social media messages to develop spatio-temporal maps of human discourse," said Dr. Warren. "These maps will track the ebb and flow of local rhetoric, and will be used as inputs to statistical models to predict the location and timing of events of civil unrest and provide new approaches to situational awareness in contested environments."
 Together with the help of Dr. Marina Cobb, a Russian language expert from the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center, the team developed a systematic list of terms in Russian, which is used to track rates of mobilization in Euro-Maidan (those who support a Ukrainian association agreement with the European Union) and anti-Maidan (those who support closer ties with Russia) groups through social-media analysis.
 Clark became involved while attending the Air Force Culture and Language Center and Air University's Language, Regional Expertise and Culture symposium at Maxwell Air Force Base in March 2018, where Cobb moderated a presentation entitled "Natural Language Processing and Geospatial/Temporal Analysis."
 "I discovered the researchers were missing 50 percent of their analytical goal because they did not have Ukrainian language expertise available," Clark said. "Though American-born, I am half-Ukrainian. My earliest childhood memories include learning about my distant ancestral homeland; my first language was Ukrainian. So I gave my business card to Dr. Cobb and she put me in contact with Dr. Warren. I have assembled a team of Ukrainian-speakers at Offutt AFB to help refine the search terms for the algorithms to better track escalating tensions in that region."
 Warren asserts analysis of spatial aggregation of multi-lingual discourse in social media messages has been shown to enhance predictions of violent events. The key component required for such analysis is a dictionary of search terms, which can be used to track ongoing conversations over space and time. If all the pieces are combined effectively, knowledge gleaned from social media can be used to gain leading indications and warnings of radicalized violence before it erupts.
 "Clark is helping us to expand our metrics to include Ukrainian Cyrillic exonyms used by both sides in the conflict, which we believe can greatly improve the predictive power of our statistical models," Warren said. "This marks a substantial advance over previous efforts."
 Through a variety of similar projects, the group hopes to continue building understanding of social media trends and warning signs associated with future military conflicts.
 "Our aim is to show that open-source data streams can be used to enhance situational awareness, and to provide leading indications of future violent events, in environments where alternative forms of human domain intelligence may be lacking," said Warren. "In any case, valuable insights can be gained from analysis of patterns in which hate speech evolves."
 The 655 Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group is dedicated to serving as the premier and most diverse ISR Group in the U.S. Air Force, delivering timely, reliable, accurate and actionable intelligence products, enabling a decision advantage over adversaries of the United States. The 655th consists of a headquarters and three tenant squadrons in Ohio, and 11 geographically separated units in California, Texas, Nebraska, Virginia, Florida and Maryland.

DAYTON —
Curious about blockchain technology? In that case, Dayton's Startup Grind community of entrepreneurs would like a bit of your time.
 Startup Grind will host Michael Hiles, founder and chief executive of 10XTS, a blockchain development company, as a guest Aug. 20.
 Titled "WTF is Blockchain anyway? Featuring Michael Hiles of 10XTS," the session is scheduled from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at 444 E. Second St., the heart of downtown Dayton's Innovation District.
 RELATED: Ohio just became more blockchain-friendly
 This month in Startup Grind communities across the nation, audiences are listening to experts in all things cryptocurrency and blockchain.
 To oversimplify a bit, blockchain is a digital ledger or record-keeping technology stored across a vast network of computers, meant to be impervious to hacking or alteration. It has served as the backbone of the bitcoin cryptocurrency.
 Recently, Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed legislation recognizing the use of blockchain technology to save and secure electronic records in an array of industries, from financial services to supply chain management, real estate and health care.

Label Insight, the Chicago-based company that helps stores tell customers what's in food and other goods, has raised $21 million in new funding, the company announced.
The company started by using its technology to scan food packaging. It collects facts like nutritional information and marketing claims, providing the data to retailers or consumer packaged-goods manufacturers.
The end result: Someone with an allergy can ask a store rep and quickly figure out what products to avoid. Retailers get a tool to help customers understand what they're buying, while companies can offer more information to sway ingredient-conscious shoppers.
The company says it works with brands like Unilever, Conagra, L'Oreal and Ocean Spray, and its database has information on more than 400,000 products. It provides that information to retailers like Albertsons, Meijer and Raley's.
Earlier last year, Label Insight announced it was expanding into products like pet food, over-the-counter medicine, vitamins and supplements, and personal care items.
CEO Paul Schaut said Label Insight plans on building its database to 1 million items with the new funding.
"The consumer's mandate for more information doesn't stop with what they eat - it includes what they put on their bodies, personal care; it includes what they feed their pets, pet food; or their babies, baby food," Schaut said. "It's not going to stop at what they buy at the grocery store. You get on a plane, you go to a restaurant, you're going to want to know more about what you're eating.
"Our business is just to support the industry any place the consumer is asking for more information."
Schaut said Label Insight currently employs about 115 people, split evenly between its Chicago and St. Louis offices. With the funding, it plans to bring that number to 170 in the next 12 months. The hires will be focused on the company's data science teams as well as its sales and marketing teams, he said.
The series C round brings the company's total funding to roughly $35 million; the company closed its last round in January 2016. Delta-v Capital led the round alongside River Cities Capital Funds. Delta-v managing partner David Schaller joins Label Insight's board along with the deal.

At San Diego's Health IQ, selling life insurance to healthy people comes with the added perk - or punishment, depending on your outlook - of practicing what you preach.
The firm, which has applied data science to craft life insurance plans that reward fitness freaks and diet do-gooders, also encourages its 140 employees to stay active and avoid sugar; there's a gym smack dab in the middle of the office and a no-candy policy, for instance.
It's this philosophy of incentivizing better choices that co-founder and CEO Munjal Shah, 44, applies inside and out of the company in the hopes that Health IQ can actually affect changes in lifestyle.
His startup, founded in 2013, seeks to make the world a healthier place one life insurance policy at time. Runners, weight-lifters and even vegans are offered life insurance plans at discounted rates, anywhere between 4 percent and 33 percent off standard monthly fees. Rates are based on scoring well on a randomized 30-question health quiz (out of 3,000 possible questions) and submitting additional data, such as weekly running mileage as verified by an approved smartphone app.
Thus far, Health IQ has convinced three carriers - SBLI, Ameritas and Assurity - to let it sell custom policies, underwritten by science and big data. The company got more than 1 million people to take its online health test and, after three years, looked at which of the respondents were still living or not. Health IQ gathered enough data to determine that those who were deemed health conscious died 41 percent less over this 3-year period than those who were not.
Enter the Health IQ life insurance business, where the basic idea is that people who take responsibility for their health should be recognized for their hard work. Or, in insurance terms, the health conscious die less and should get lower premiums.
It's the inverse approach most often taken by the insurance industry, where people are penalized for their poor choices, not necessarily celebrated for good ones. The Health IQ way started with a simple thought, inspired by Shah's own battle with the bulge and the recognition that you can't force people to get off the couch.
"What if we try to improve health by celebrating the people doing it right instead of harassing people who are doing it wrong?," Shah said.
Validating the idea is the Bay Area powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, which just led a $35 million financing round, announced recently, in Health IQ. The venture capital firm, famous for making investments in Facebook, Slack and Airbnb, is backing Health IQ's life insurance play alongside other recognizable names, including Charles River Ventures, First Round Capital and Foundation Capital.
To date, Health IQ has raised $81 million in capital.
"(Shah) proved through data that people living a healthy lifestyle live longer," said Charles Moldow, general partner at Foundation Capital and a Health IQ board member.
That gives the company an edge, he explained, because the data is proprietary and is being used to create a new underwriting formula.
Of course, there's also Shah's entrepreneurial pedigree. The UCSD computer science graduate has sold two companies to two different tech titans: Like.com to Google (for a speculated $100 million) and Andale to Alibaba.
Then, there's the fact that Health IQ is part of an insurance tech boom.
"It's definitely been a hot area for financial technology over the past couple of years," said Matt Wong, a senior analyst with finance-tracking firm CB Insights. "By and large, we're seeing a lot of startups try to create new digital brands centered around user experience."
Insurance tech startups pulled in $985 million in financing during the second quarter of this year, and experts anticipate continued investment, and perhaps overcrowding, as tech companies race to make over the front-end of the highly regulated industry. Even more traditional carriers are anxious to participate in the trend, establishing their own corporate venture arms or digital brands, Wong said.
Of course, Health IQ is narrowly focused on the already health conscious - runners, cyclists, swimmers, vegans or even people successfully managing a chronic disease. Still, the startup estimates that more than 50 million people in the U.S. fit into this category. Board-member Moldow believes that it's a niche worth tens of billions of dollars.
Since making its first life insurance plans available 22 months ago, the company has sold more than $5.3 billion in coverage to customers, banking a commission on each policy. But that's just scratching the surface. Most athletes probably aren't aware that they can save money on a life insurance policy, Shah said, and Health IQ has ambitions that extend to long-term care and disability insurance. Hence the $35 million cash infusion, which Shah and his investors hope can help fuel growth at an even faster pace.
"Today, nobody searches for 'life insurance for runners.' Awareness needs to be created for this category," Shah said. "People should know that when you finish a marathon you should refinance your life insurance."
Internally, at Health IQ, staffers at both its San Diego and Bay Area offices are encouraged to walk the walk. The whole company participates in 30-minute workout sessions, in the gym at the center of the office, four times per week. Sugar is also a banned substance, meaning that while the company won't monitor what employees eat, it also doesn't make sweets and sodas available in its break areas.
And, in a perfect world, a company that supports healthy lifestyles internally will have more success advocating for and attracting health conscious customers.

Makenzie Marzluff is "spreading glitter" through the sale of her all natural dessert hummus. She opened her business "Delighted by Hummus" last year and is growing the company nationally. CONTRIBUTED PHOTOS
Available in four flavors, Makenzie Marzluff's dessert hummus is taking off, thanks to her business "Delighted by Hummus." The all natural product fits perfectly into a "clean eating" diet.
Jack Martin
FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE PERSONAL JOURNEY
Centerville High School friends Makenzie Marzluff and Jack Martin never talked business when they played together in the high school orchestra - she played violin and he, cello. In fact, the 2006 graduates ended up going their separate ways - Marzluff to Arizona to attend college closer to her parents and Martin to Ohio University in Athens.
That was until a unique business venture of Marzluff's brought
again last year - marketing and selling dessert hummus, a productMarzluff created herself.
"I was born and raised in Dayton," Martin said. "I graduated from OU with a degree in communicationsandshortly
working as a technical recruiter in New York City."
Marzluff said she had always thought about owning a business. "I was thinking about owning a restaurant or a hair salon," she said. "But when I was in high school, that option wasn't really given to me. I just was supposed to go to college and get a stable job."
She moved to Phoenix and graduated with a degree in nutrition and was encouraged by family and friends to become a doctor.
"I wanted to own my own business and I wanted to see another culture," Marzluff said. "So I moved to Australia in 2010 and opened a nutrition and Pilate's center and just learned as I went."
In 2012, Marzluff sold her business and moved back to Phoenix. She became involved with an organization called "Seed Spot," which supports budding entrepreneurs and offers education and training.
After some soul searching and a retreat in Sedona, Marzluff said she discovered a purpose for her life. "I launched 'Delighted by Hummus' in the spring of 2015," she said. "It was my fourth entrepreneurial venture."
Marzluff had been making dessert hummus for friends for some time. They frequently asked for this unique twist on the traditional chickpea dip, (usually made with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic), made with sweeter ingredients like coconut sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate.
"I was in the kitchen, and I suddenly knew what my purpose was," Marzluff said. "My hobby was to make food and making my hummus for everyone was going to be how I was going to spread my light or my 'glitter.'"
Marzluff quit her job the next day and launched into the business full time, saying it all made "so much sense. Within a month, we were up and running full time and selling our product at the farmers market in Phoenix."
Meanwhile, Martin was working on Madison Avenue. "The work was more aggressive than anything I have ever seen in my life," he said. "My office felt like a trading floor but the environment taught me some amazing business skills."
Martin decided to learn about computer programming and was a natural. "I dove into the open source community," he said. "Learning Python, Django, data science and automation engineering with an aggressive business focus."
With those skills under his belt, Martin found his friend Marzluff on the social media site, Linkedin, and said he knew he'd be able to help her right away. "I sent her a message and she agreed that it could be a great match," he said.
Hearing from her old friend again after so many years was a surprise, and "so random," but Marzluff said it seemed his skills would be a great asset to her business. "Jack's really good at what he does," she said. "So I asked him to come into the business with me."
Martin's role in the company is technology and growth while Marzluff remains at the helm and is the creative focus for the business.
Devoted to making a quality product with all natural ingredients, Marzluff said the mission behind the company is to "spread glitter" or light, wherever they go and to inspire others to do the same. The company's dessert hummus, available in four flavors, is currently sold through national supermarket chain Wegman's with more retail expansion to come over the next several months.
"It's been a process figuring out how we could seal the product and maintain integrity without adding preservatives," Marzluff said. "I wasn't willing to compromise on ingredients. Our product fits into clean eating perfectly."
Martin will continue to work closely with Marzluff as the company expands into single serve and snack packs to attract moms with young kids.
"My role is technology and growth," Martin said. "By using many custom software tools and some awesome hummus, we are easily able to grab Google rankings, Facebook likes, Twitter followers, Instagram followers and most importantly, a tremendous network of supportive and health conscious individuals that love dessert hummus."

Martin will continue to work closely with Marzluff as the company expands into single serve and snack packs to attract moms with young kids.
"My role is technology and growth," Martin said. "By using many custom software tools and some awesome hummus, we are easily able to grab Google rankings, Facebook likes, Twitter followers, Instagram followers and most importantly, a tremendous network of supportive and health conscious individuals that love dessert hummus."

The first step for a shopper buying a suit at the fast-growing menswear retailer Indochino is sharing his personal information: A salesperson armed with an iPad measures nearly everything on his body, from the distance between his belly button and rear to the circumference of his knees.
The next step is getting a customized, made-to-measure suit delivered to his home within a few weeks. But his body data lives on: Company executives are hoping to build a "master data model" that would connect his measurements with his advertising, shopping and spending histories.
Clothing companies now see body measurements as one of their most prized currencies, and millions of Americans are increasingly offering up their innermost personal data in search of customized pieces or a better fit.
Companies such as Indochino, Wantable and Stitch Fix, the latter of which counted nearly $1 billion in sales last year, gather dozens of data points on each customer, including weight, jobs and past pregnancies. They are being joined by Amazon.com, the online-retail giant that counts fashion among its fastest-growing businesses and now sells a bedroom camera that offers opinions on what a user wears.
But the corporate harvest of data about our bodies, including our faces, voices and fingerprints, also is raising privacy concerns about how much sharing is too much in service of better-fitting clothes.
"These body measurements look a lot like medical records," said Peter Swire, a law professor at the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business who coordinated with the White House in the 1990s during the shaping of the nation's medical privacy law.
Those health privacy rules, Swire said, "would apply to this data if the measurements were taken at the hospital. It doesn't apply when an online company puts them in an app."
Clothing profile
Companies value this data because it can lock customers in for life and make it easy to order customized clothes over the internet without trying anything on. But some privacy experts question whether Americans have a clear idea of what they are handing over.
"There's a little bit of a weirdness about it. You're letting people into your life," said Autumn Rocha, a 26-year-old student in Baltimore and Stitch Fix client. "But there's also something cool about it: 'This is what I'm into. What can you find for me?'"
A new Stitch Fix customer fills out a profile that compiles up to 85 data points. A woman is asked if she is a mother or currently pregnant, as well as her due date. She also hands over her dress, waist and bra size; her age, job and location; parts of the body she would like to flaunt or downplay; and answers to more-abstract questions, such as whether she likes taking risks.
Algorithms use that data to pick through Stitch Fix's inventory, referring options to a human "stylist" who decides on which to send. The customer pays to keep the clothes she likes and can send back anything she doesn't. She can't, however, go on the site and pick things out; her only choice is what the algorithms recommend.
The company says it can better assess style by having access to customers' Pinterest and Instagram accounts, which many customers willingly share. Company executives said others go a step further, sharing details of life milestones - new jobs, recent divorces, upcoming vacations and funerals - to define the clothes they are looking for.
Stitch Fix chief algorithms officer Eric Colson said he was surprised at how quickly customers were willing to share so much about themselves. At Netflix, where he previously led data science and engineering, the streaming-video service pushed to keep new users interested by removing as many questions at sign-up as possible. But at Stitch Fix, where building a profile can involve answering more than 80 personal questions, the follow-through rate is one of the highest Colson said he has ever seen.
"People love to fill out that questionnaire," he said.
'Client journey'
Stitch Fix refers to its data-gathering in the terms of a lifelong relationship: Customers go on a "client journey," and the company pledges to be a "partner for life." In a presentation to investors in November, Stitch Fix outlined the spending history of a 36-year-old Indiana doctor whom, through switches to maternity wear, they could track through three pregnancies.
The company distinguishes itself to investors by saying it has rich, high-quality data provided directly by the client rather than taken from other sources. Customers are "motivated" to share as much personal detail as possible, the company said in financial filings late last year, "because they recognize that doing so will result in more personalized and successful experiences."
The technology has helped the company achieve incredible growth. Its more than 2 million active clients drove nearly $1 billion in sales last year, more than 10 times the company's revenue in 2014. The company has in a few years become one of the biggest online clothes sellers in the United States, with sales last year that rivaled department store giant J.C. Penney, according to data from market researcher Euromonitor.
Executives say this level of data has helped them gain ground in parts of middle America where fashion options are limited. Stitch Fix also says the data has helped it capture an underserved market of American women by offering styles and sizes they might not find in their local department store.

Racist tweets may help predict hate crimes; Researchers in L.A. will monitor social media for trends.

LOS ANGELES - Can police prevent hate crimes by monitoring racist banter on social media?
Researchers will be testing this concept over the next three years in Los Angeles, marking a new frontier in efforts by law enforcement to predict and prevent crimes.
During a three-year experiment, British researchers working with the Santa Monica, Calif.-based RAND Corp. will be monitoring millions of tweets related to the L.A. area in an effort to identify patterns and markers that prejudice-motivated violence is about to occur in real time.
The researchers then will compare the data against records of reported violent acts. The U.S. Department of Justice is investing $600,000 in research by Cardiff University Social Data Science Lab, which has been at the forefront of predictive social media models.
Cardiff University professor Matthew Williams said the research is designed to eventually enable authorities to predict when and where hate crime is likely to occur and deploy law enforcement resources to prevent it.
"The insights provided by our work will help U.S. localities to design policies to address specific hate crime issues unique to their jurisdiction and allow service providers to tailor their services to the needs of victims, especially if those victims are members of an emerging category of hate crime targets."
His lab's previous research in the United Kingdom found that Twitter data can be used to identify areas where hate speechisoccurringbutwhere no hate crimes have been committed. This can be useful, researchers said, in neighborhoods with many new immigrants, who are unlikely to report the crime because of fear of deportation.
In 2012, an estimated 293,800 nonfatal violent and propertyhatecrimesoccurred in the United States, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 60 percent of those were not reported, theJusticeDepartmentfound.
Of course, there is a big difference between someone spouting off on Twitter or Snapchat and an actual hate crime.
"It is a great idea in the abstract. But it is not the panacea you might think," said Brian Levin, executive director of Cal State San Bernardino's Center on Hate and Extremism. "The problem is the correlation and reliability. ... There are many different forms of social media."
Levin,whohastrackedboth Middle Eastern terror groups and local neo-Nazi organizations, also noted that some hate groups don't advertise their work on social media.
"Local tensions may arise to fly and be absent from social media," he said. "Some segments of the community shun social media ... so examining social media as a predictor can be a bit like having one screwdriver and sometimes it doesn't work."
Predictive policing already is in use at the Los Angeles Police Department and other agencies. The LAPD uses a predictive policing algorithm to deploy officers to locations where prior crime patterns strongly suggest similar crimes may occur. As crime during the last two decades has dropped dramatically across the nation and Los Angeles, police commanders are increasingly looking for any edge they can get in cutting crime.
L.A. County is particularly useful because a huge volume of social media produces massive data sets that increase the accuracy of predictive models over traditional crime analysis and trend-chasing, said Pete Bur-nap, from Cardiff University's School of Computer Science and Informatics.

The tech market expanded 2% last year to approximately 7.3 million workers.
SAN FRANCISCO Demand for the nation's more than 1.8 million software engineers has hundreds of companies scrambling for talent in machine learning and data sciences.
The battle is pitched in coastal cities such as San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston and New York, where start-ups and established companies are dangling six-figure salaries, benefits and the chance to do interesting research, according to a study that was released this week by LinkedIn.
The social network for professionals looked at data for engineering talent on its network in March.
Machine learning and data science skills rank as the most in-demand, though both specialties have the least experienced workforces - at less than five years - because they are emerging fields. Consequently, they are fetching the highest compensation, at a median of $129,000 annually.
In the competition for engineers, Seattle - home of Amazon and Microsoft - has emerged as an aggressive bidder, offering $132,000 a year.
The race for software engineers isn't surprising.
The booming tech market expanded 2% last year to approximately 7.3 million workers as the digital economy continued to flourish in jobs for software, cybersecurity and cloud computing, according to Cyberstates 2017, an annual analysis of the nation's tech industry by technology association CompTIA.
The vast majority - 6.9 million - were employed by tech companies.
Yet hundreds of thousands of jobs remain unfilled, and demand is tightening due to the need for highly skilled workers in non-tech industries such as banking and health care. (LinkedIn lists more than 300,000 open engineering jobs.)
All told, about 4% of the U.S. workforce is employed in the $1.3 trillion industry, about 8% of the national economy, says Tim Herbert, senior vice president for research and market intelligence at CompTIA.

'SHARING' REMAKES HOW WE TRAVEL; From Airbnb to Tours by Locals to Purple Dinner, technology has transformed tourism, giving travelers local experiences everywhere.; COVER STORY

Through a food tour organized by ToursbyLocals.com, travelers were able to meet Rosita Cariani and Marco Biagetti, butchers at Macelleria Tagliavento in Bevagna, Italy. ToursbyLocals is one of a number of new businesses in the travel"sharing"economy.
In a phenomenon dubbed the "sharing economy" or "peer-to-peer marketplace," Americans are traveling in ways that were virtually unheard of a decade ago. They're vacationing at the homes of strangers, driving (and being driven) around cities in other people's cars and exploring destinations with the people who live there.
Elisa Dias of Congers, N.Y., has rented apartments with Airbnb for family vacations with her husband, 20-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son in Paris, Amsterdam and London. "We appreciated having a kitchen and living room where we could unwind and spend time together," she said. "While more expensive than one hotel room, it cost less than two."
"We like to get a flavor of local life," Dias added. In Amsterdam, the family shopped in a local market and used bikes to get around. "The owners generously shared information about their neighborhoods, especially restaurants and public transportation," she said. On each trip, the family hired local guides from ToursbyLocals (www.toursbylocals.com), whom Dias described as "people who loved their cities."
Launched in 2008, Airbnb (www.airbnb.com) is the largest player in the growing home-sharing niche: Anyone who hasn't already used Airbnb or been a host probably knows someone who has. The company has matched more than 60 million guests and hosts in more than 34,000 cities or towns in over 190 countries.
In 2011, 1 in 10 U.S. travelers rented all or part of someone else's private dwelling (a house, apartment or condo). That proportion rose to a staggering 1 in 4 by 2014, according to data from industry research firm Phocuswright.
"We've seen rapid growth not only in Airbnb but also in other home-rental businesses such as Booking.com (an online travel agency owned by Priceline) and Homeaway (www.homeaway.com)," said Douglas Quinby, Phocuswright vice president for research. "More and more travelers are considering rentals as an accommodations option planning their leisure trips."
"Internet technology and the ubiquitousness of tablets and smartphones have been game changers," said Jon Gray, chief revenue officer at Homeaway. "Someone who had a second home to rent in Destin, Fla., used to have to place an ad in the Atlanta newspaper," he said. "Now it's just as easy to rent it to someone from London."
Quinby sees these changes as indicators of just how mainstream private accommodations are becoming in the travel industry. "And while it may be the most high-profile example of the sharing economy, by no means is it alone," he said. A nationwide consumer survey conducted jointly by the Travel Technology Association and the Internet Association reported that in 2015, nearly half of all Americans (46 percent) participated in one or more aspects of the sharing economy.
Other examples:
Services such as Uber (www.uber.com) and Lyft (www. lyft.com) are connecting passengers with drivers, posing challenges to a struggling taxi industry. FlightCar (           www.flightcar.com), Turo (           www.turo.com) and Getaround (           www.getaround.com) are peer-to-peer services that enable travelers to rent cars from private owners. Via (           www.ridewithvia.com) and Bandwagon (           www.bandwagon.io) allow travelers (and commuters) to share rides in taxis and chauffeured vehicles.
Once travelers have reached their destinations (in addition to ToursbyLocals, the group used by Dias), a bevy of companies such as Context Travel (www.contexttravel.com), Viator (owned by TripAdvisor) (           www.viator.com), Your Local Cousin (           www.yourlocalcousin.com) and Vayable (           www.vayable.com) have emerged to help tourists experience what truly makes a place unique.
"Tourists want to get off the cattle car," said Paul Bennett of Philadelphia-based Context Travel, a company he co-founded with his wife 13 years ago. "They want to break down barriers between themselves and the places they're visiting. Beyond seeing monuments, they want to share experiences with people who live there and learn about their customs and culture," he said.
Last year Context booked 10,000 individuals or small groups (fewer than six people) for walking seminars in 37 large cities across the globe. The company matches travelers with expert "docents," a carefully chosen network of local graduate students and scholars, including art historians, writers, architects and gastronomes.
Similarly, travelers who are food enthusiasts have embraced the concept of social dining. Online platforms such as PurpleDinner (www.purpledinner.com), Meal Sharing (           www.mealsharing.com), Bonappetour (           www.bonappetour.com) and EatWith (           www.eatwith.com) enable tourists to eat home-cooked meals (at a minimal cost per person) and simultaneously get an insider's glimpse at the homes of their hosts.
"Homes" don't always have to be houses or apartments. There are Airbnb-type businesses for boaters too. With boats sitting in marinas with only infrequent use, GetMyBoat (www.getmyboat.com) collected an inventory of more than 40,000 boats in 143 countries - from kayaks to 150-foot yachts - available for rent or charter.
Although early adopters were largely tech-savvy young people, the demographics of sharing have become more ecumenical. "Unlike other emerging technologies, the peer-to-peer economy is distributed across all ages," said Steve Shur, president of the Travel Technology Association.
Users run the gamut from budget to luxury. Couchsurfing (www.couchsurfing.com) is a community of 12 million members who sleep on other people's couches or in spare bedrooms at no charge. At the other end of the spectrum are affluent travelers who "share" multimillion-dollar homes without the risks and costs of solo ownership. They are buying into private vacation clubs such as Exclusive Resorts (           www.exclusiveresorts.com), Inspirato with American Express (           www.inspirato.com) and Quintess (www.quintess. com).
Summerinitaly.com ranges up and down the economic scale from affordable to virtual palaces, some of the most breathtaking being along the Amalfi Coast.
Wealthy travelers also are purchasing fractional shares and usage of jets in hourly increments from NetJets (www.net-jets.com), Flexjet (           www.flexjet.com), Sentient Jet (           www.sentient.com) and Wheels Up (           www.wheel-sup.com).
With air travel, it doesn't stop there. Technology has fundamentally altered the possibilities of matching underutilized resources with demand. Data science company Boxever surveyed 500 travelers about the future of air travel and found 40 percent would consider on-demand, in-flight services from other passengers such as massages, manicures/pedicures and business training, if they were made available.
Many see the growth of the sharing economy as a win-win scenario for travelers as well as for those who own assets. It offers cost savings as well as improved access to a wider array of options. "The trend is not exclusively economic," said Chip Conley, head of global hospitality and strategy at Airbnb. "It also appeals to our need for social belonging, allowing travelers to understand and make connections with people from all over the world."
This seismic shift in the way we travel isn't without naysayers. Critics contend it drives up housing costs, diminishes the character of neighborhoods and poses a competitive threat to existing segments of the travel industry (especially hotels and taxis). Also troubling, regulatory safeguards for consumers and liability issues haven't been fully addressed. In addition, online review systems that allow owners and consumers to vet one another are helpful but imperfect.
Marina Krakovsky, author of "The Middleman Economy" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), points out that the term "sharing economy" itself may be a misnomer. "As soon as money enters the picture, you're no longer sharing. You're engaged in market transactions with a middleman making it all work
- facilitating search, handling payment and instilling trust in both buyers and sellers," she said.

Toyota is forming a new data science company in partnership with Microsoft that's designed to free customers "from the tyranny of technology."
The company called Toyota Connected has a goal of simplifying technology so it's easier to use, perhaps even getting rid of distracting and complicated touch screens that now are in most cars and replacing them with heads-up or voice-activated technology, said Zack Hicks, the company's CEO who also is Toyota Motor America's chief information officer.
"I think people are really tired of fumbling with multiple devices and having this disjointed experience," Hicks said as Toyota announced the venture April 4.
Like other automakers, Toyota Connected will research connecting cars to each other and to homes, as well as telematics features that learn and anticipate a driver's habits. The company, like other automakers, will explore transmitting a driver's health data to a doctor or driving patterns to an insurance company so people are insured based on where they travel, Toyota said. Also, it will look at linking with other vehicles so they can report weather and traffic conditions to people driving the same route.
The move comes as automakers prepare for big changes in transportation that are coming in the next several years including steps toward self-driving cars. Tesla Motors, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and others are rolling out cars that can drive themselves on freeways

Tim Berners-Lee
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, now wants to save it.
The computer scientist who wrote the blueprint for what would become the World Wide Web 28 years ago on Sunday is alarmed at what has happened to it in the past year.
"Over the past 12 months, I've become increasingly worried about three new trends, which I believe we must tackle in order for the Web to fulfill its true potential as a tool which serves all of humanity," he said in a statement issued from London. He cited compromised personal data; fake news that he says has "spread like wildfire"; and the lack of regulation in political advertising,
which he says threatens
democracy.
"Even in countries where we believe governments have citizens' best interests at heart, watching everyone, all the time is simply going too far," he said, in an allusion to WikiLeaks' disclosure of what documents claim is a vast CIA surveillance operation. "It creates a chilling effect on free speech and stops the Web from being used as a space to explore important topics, like sensitive health issues, sexuality or religion."
Berners-Lee, 61, who was knighted, founded Web Foundation in 2009 to improve the Web as part of a five-year plan.
When Berners-Lee submitted his original proposal for the Web, he imagined it as an open platform that would allow everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundaries. But his faith has been shaken by a series of high-profile hacks and the dissemination of fake news - a topic of several panels at SXSW - through the use of data science and bots.
Berners-Lee is just the latest to share concerns over what former Cisco Systems exec Monique Morrow calls a fundamental assault on privacy and cybersecurity. "How do we use technology responsibly?" she asked at a SXSW talk in Austin on Saturday.

Is never-ending car payment a bad thing?; NERSOLAL FILALCE

Car payments have morphed from a temporary nuisance into a permanent part of many people's budgets. Whether that's a bad thing depends on what you do with the rest of your money.
One-third of millennial car buyers chose a lease last year, which helped push auto lease volume to a record of 4.3 million and 31 percent of all new auto purchases, according to market research by Edmunds.com.
"There is a greater percentage of people who view car ownership as a monthly payment like their cell phone or cable or Wi-Fi," says Jessica Caldwell, executive director of strategic analytics at Edmunds.com. "It's just the way we live our lives."
Lease payments are typically lower than monthly loan payments for the same car, and leasing is less expensive than buying new cars every two or three years. But leasing is far from frugal, especially compared with paying off a car within five years and owning it for a few more. People who lease don't get a break from payments or build equity toward the next purchase.
But younger buyers in particular are more likely to view cars as technology that needs to be continually upgraded, Caldwell says.
"It used to be cars didn't change that much in five years. Now they do," she says.
(Even Consumer Reports , which typically recommends buying over leasing, suggests leasing electric cars because the technology is changing so fast.)
Fear of repair bills contributes to the leasing trend as well. Many people would rather have constant payments and continually drive newer cars than be surprised by repair costs - especially in an era when 46 percent of households don't have $400 in savings to cover an emergency, according to the Federal Reserve.
"Your costs with a lease, while higher, are also more predictable," says Alex Klein, vice president for data science for Autolist, a new and used car search engine.
Younger buyers also are less convinced they'll need a car five years from now, Klein says.
"There's more flexibility about the idea of car ownership," Klein says. "In two or three years, I may get around in an autonomous Uber."
Millennial car owners plan to own their cars for less time than their Generation X predecessors, an Autolist study of 3,383 vehicle owners found.

Car payments have morphed from a temporary nuisance into a permanent part of many people's budgets. Whether that's a bad thing depends on what you do with the rest of your money.
One-third of millennial car buyers chose a lease last year, which helped push auto lease volume to a record of 4.3 million and 31 percent of all new auto purchases, according to market research by Edmunds.com.
"There is a greater percentage of people who view car ownership as a monthly payment like their cell phone or cable or Wi-Fi," says Jessica Caldwell, executive director of strategic analytics at Edmunds.com. "It's just the way we live our lives."
Lease payments are typically lower than monthly loan payments for the same car, and leasing is less expensive than buying new cars every two or three years. But leasing is far from frugal, especially compared with paying off a car within five years and owning it for a few more. People who lease don't get a break from payments or build equity toward the next purchase.
But younger buyers in particular are more likely to view cars as technology that needs to be continually upgraded, Caldwell says.
"It used to be cars didn't change that much in five years. Now they do," she says.
(Even Consumer Reports , which typically recommends buying over leasing, suggests leasing electric cars because the technology is changing so fast.)
Fear of repair bills contributes to the leasing trend as well. Many people would rather have constant payments and continually drive newer cars than be surprised by repair costs - especially in an era when 46 percent of households don't have $400 in savings to cover an emergency, according to the Federal Reserve.
"Your costs with a lease, while higher, are also more predictable," says Alex Klein, vice president for data science for Autolist, a new and used car search engine.
Younger buyers also are less convinced they'll need a car five years from now, Klein says.
"There's more flexibility about the idea of car ownership," Klein says. "In two or three years, I may get around in an autonomous Uber."
Millennial car owners plan to own their cars for less time than their Generation X predecessors, an Autolist study of 3,383 vehicle owners found.

Pepper, a humanoid robot made by Softbank Robotics.
As soon as you approach Pepper, a 4-foot-tall robot, she starts sizing you up.
Thanks to facial recognition capabilities, Pepper can determine your gender and age bracket. And as you begin asking her questions, she can draw from a vast volume of cloud-based information to give what she thinks are relevant answers. If you smile, she can tell the conversation is going well and that you're finding her answers helpful. If you don't, she might ask you if she's misunderstanding your requests.
Pepper's maker, Softbank Robotics, has a vision of a world in which many retailers incorporate this technology into brick-and-mortar stores, in which it feels normal and reflexive for you to approach a robot with customer service questions.
It's part of a wider push across the retail industry to bring more automation and data science to one of the few parts of the business that largely remains an art: the act of making a sale.
At the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an event here attended by tens of thousands of industry professionals, demonstrations abounded of technology that could assist a store employee in closing the deal - or, in some cases, that could answer the very questions clerks might typically help with.
These innovations present tantalizing possibilities for retailers, whocanillaffordtoloseanyopportunity to satisfy or even upsell a customer at a time when mall foot traffic is tumbling precipitously. But the advances also raise thorny questions about what the retail workforce of the future will look like if a growing array of tasks can soon be punted to robots or tablet applications.
When you first encounter Pepper, it's hard not to be struck by the quirky novelty of the situation: You're being chatted up by something that looks part anime cartoon, part "Star Wars" storm-trooper. And yet the interaction feels strangely familiar, because of how uncannily humanoid her gestures are. From the way she cocks her head when asking a question to the way her fingers curl up when she draws her hands to her hips, it all feels very integrated.
Because of that, "one of the challenges we have from a marketing perspective is managing your expectations of what a robot like this can do," said Steve Carlin, vice president at Softbank Robotics.
In other words, the form-factor is so compelling that people start asking Pepper questions that, at least for now, are out of her depth.
Demonstrators offered several possible use cases for Pepper: Retailers could position her at an endcap - the eye-catching display at the head of an aisle - or in a specialty department, where she could answer questions about a featured product. Or she could help you identify which shoes you might want to buy based on what your priorities are. On a budget? She'll steer you toward the cheapest pair. Like to be comfortable? She'll suggest a functional pair of sneakers.
After being used at Softbank Mobile stores in Japan for several years, Pepper made her debut in the U.S. market in November, launching at two Westfield Malls in California. In that iteration, she is programmed to do things like give shoppers directions to a certain store.
Don't expect to start seeing a massive army of Peppers right away: Softbank says that there is only one facility in the United States that is currently equipped to service and repair the robots, and the company doesn't want to deploy the technology too widely until it has built out more logistics and capacity for managing that.
Plus, they don't think they've come close yet to unlocking the full range of what Pepper is capable of, as software developers are still being unleashed to write programs forthetechnology.Think,forexample, about how you initially came to understand the smartphone's power: it was largely thanks to apps built for those devices.
Retailers may be more apt to get on the bandwagon when they can see more use cases. So might hotels, cruise ships, airports or other places that rely on customer service.
Pepper's makers stress that they don't see the technology as something that replaces human workers. Rather, they see it as a supplement. While Pepper is answering simple questions such as, "Where's the restroom?," the theory goes, a sales associate can be handling complextaskssuchasrecommending shoes to go with your dress, or helping you find the last pair of jeans in your size.
The idea of technology as a support system for a sales clerk could be seen at other displays during NRF's trade show. Toshiba, for example, showed off something it calls Lift 'n Learn. When a shopper lifts an item off a shelf, it triggers more information about that product to come up on a large screen behind the display. But certain customer actions can also send a notification to a sales associate that someone is interacting with that display, providing an opportunity for an employee to swoop in, recommend related products, and so on.
Findmine is a startup that uses artificial intelligence to curate complete outfits from a retailer's current merchandise assortment. (You may have seen the technology on e-commerce sites such as John Varvatos, where it powers a "complete this look" module that shows you a sweater, shoes and jacket that would look good with thejeansyouclickedon.)Findmine has the ability to deploy this technology in physical stores, too. So, it could be incorporated into tablets that associates tote around the store. Then, when they notice you are really loving a certain button-down shirt, the employee could use the technology to make recommendations to you about a full ensemble that is consistent with the brand's aesthetic.
There are other cases where a worker wouldn't have to step in at all. Philips Lighting demonstrated a technology called visible light communications, or VLC, in which store lighting can be used to pinpoint your precise positioning and facing within an aisle of a store. (For this to work, you have to have your smartphone out of your pocket and have opted in to allowing the retailer's app to locate you.)
A spokesman offered an example of how this might be used in a pharmacy for what he called "selective selling": If you're hovering around the flu medicine, maybe the retailer's app could also nudge you to also buy tissues and cough drops.
None of these technologies threatens to completely replace sales associates. But collectively, they might either chip away at the value of those kinds of roles, or at very least alter the skills they call for. Either way, it suggests we're on the cusp of major change in what it means to be on the front lines at the mall, big-box store or supermarket.

WIKILEAKS: CIA CAN HACK INTO PHONES, TVS - EVERYTHING; Intelligence agency has now 'lost control' of most of its cyberattack arsenal, anti-secrecy site says

WikiLeaks says the hundreds of millions of lines of code it published Tuesday represent "the entire hacking capacity of the CIA."
The crusading website Wiki-Leaks published thousands of documents Tuesday it says detail CIA tools for hacking into Web servers, computers, smart-phones and even TVs that can be turned into covert microphones.
The website claims the CIA Center for Cyber Intelligence "lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal," more than several hundred million lines of code that provide "the entire hacking capacity of the CIA."
Jake Williams, a security expert with the Georgia-based security firm Rendition Infosec, said the information will be used within days or weeks by hackers and the security firms that combat them.
"My first thought was 'Wow!' quickly followed by the realization that this is a treasure trove of information," he said. "We are regularly dealing with corporations being attacked by nation-state hacking groups. This gives us a lot of insight into how they do it."
White House spokesman Sean Spicer, questioned at a news briefing, declined to comment on the release.
"These (leaks) appear to be very, very serious," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told reporters at a briefing. "We are extremely concerned, and we are following it closely."
The documents indicate developers created programs in homage to popular culture, such as an implant for computers running Microsoft Windows dubbed "RickyBobby" after the Will Ferrell character in the 2006 film Talladega Nights. A trojan spread via thumb drives was named "Fight Club," a reference to the 1996 novel and 1999 movie starring Brad Pitt. A smart TV project was called Weeping Angel - recurring villains in the Doctor Who series who move only when no one is watching.
The CIA issued a statement declining comment on the "purported" documents. USA TODAY has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the documents nor seen anything in them to indicate the tools were used in the U.S. - or at all.
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., called for a congressional investigation into the details contained in the files. "The potential privacy concerns are mind-boggling," said Lieu, who has a degree in computer science. "We need to know if the CIA lost control of its hacking tools, who may have those tools, and how do we now protect the privacy of Americans."
WikiLeaks says the archive appears to have been circulated among former government hackers and contractors, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with portions of it. The website says the CIA hacking division involved "more than 5,000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other 'weaponized' malware."
"Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook," WikiLeaks says. "The CIA had created, in effect, its 'own NSA' with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified."
The source of the information, which WikiLeaks did not name, hopes the document dump will initiate "a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons," the website says.
According to WikiLeaks, Apple's iPhone, Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows and Samsung smart TVs were among the CIA's targets. The TVs can be placed in a "fake off" mode so the owner believes the TV is off when it is on, the documents say. "In 'fake off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server," WikiLeaks says.
Microsoft, Google and Whats-App were among tech firms saying they were looking into the WikiLeaks report. Scott Vernick, a partner with the data security law firm of Fox Rothschild in Philadelphia, said the documents raise the question of whether the CIA shared its tools with the FBI for use in domestic investigations.
WikiLeaks released thousands of hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of last year's presidential election in a cyberattack the U.S. intelligence community concluded was carried out by Russia in an attempt to interfere in the race. WikiLeaks has denied getting the emails from Russia, which also said it was not involved in the hacking.
Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame professor who specializes in data science, says the release reinforces the idea that all information in our lives can be acquired and leveraged in ways most people don't even think about.
"Probably the most disturbing part of the story," he says, "was that this information was being shared between former U.S. government hackers and contractors with no oversights and no authorization."
