Ralf Siemens: 2021 candidate for North Barrington village board Seven candidates for three seats Bio City: North Barrington Age: 58 Occupation: Self-employed Software Product Management – Data Science/Analytics Civic involvement: Big Brothers of Canada – 1996-2000. Calgary Big Brother of the Year – 1998. Lake Zurich Baseball Coach – 2015-2018 Q&amp;A Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state and federal authorities? A: Help people where I can, such as arrange rides as needed. No one, especially elected officials, should stand in the way of county, state, and federal authorities who are doing the best job at organizing and distributing the vaccine. Q: Did your town continue to adequately serve its constituents during the disruptions caused by the pandemic?
 If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: The online presence for self-help services is inadequate. For example, the vehicle stickers should have been a streamlined online process years ago. The pandemic would have been a perfect opportunity to do so. The only thing that went online is payment processing using a cumbersome state system, yet everything is still manual. Automating these functions will increase compliance, thereby increasing revenue. The whole mantra is to make it simple — people will pay if it's simple. Q: In light of our experiences with COVID-19, what safeguards/guidelines should you put in place to address any future public health crises? A: The Village needs to ensure and promote that the scientists and CDC guidance is followed. Q: What cuts can local government make to reduce the burden of the pandemic on taxpayers? A: Local government can ensure that any federal or state aid is distributed fairly to those in need, and if local government does not have a role in that, it should ensure that budgets and budget line items are balanced and any possible downturns in property valuations are prepared for by making contracts flexible so that if revenue declines, contracts decline proportionally. Q: What do you see as the most important infrastructure project you must address? Why and how should it be paid for? Conversely, during these uncertain economic times, what infrastructure project can be put on the back burner? A: The primary project to address is the policing contract. The current contract is with the Lake County Sheriff department and is not fully funded. This impacts other budget line items of the Village's budget; a budget that is not readily available for review currently. Transparency is lacking which affects trustees' ability to review and comment on each line item. Reviewing the Police contract, which is shared with Lake Barrington, is needed to evenly redistribute the burden on both communities. Addressing the police contract will free up funds for road maintenance and flooding issues in order to get the attention they deserve. Q: Do you plan to address businesses that don't adhere to the governor's order to close or restrict business? A: I will fully support adherence to any directive from the county and state's health departments as well as the CDC. Q: Do you agree or disagree with the stance your board/council has taken on permitting recreational marijuana sales in the community? What would you change about that stance, if you could? A: The Village does not have a stance on recreational marijuana sales that I am aware of. I fully support a referendum in North Barrington and let the voters decide this issue if a new revenue stream would be desirable. Currently there are dispensaries in surrounding communities, but the Village does not receive any revenue from those sources. Q: What's one good idea you have to better the community that no one is talking about yet? A: Automate the vehicle sticker program, using a self-help portal. It will increase compliance which is currently only about 50%, increase revenue, reduce the manual labor and associated costs, and encourages automatic annual renewals. I can apply my experience and expertise to oversee the planning, designing, budgeting and the execution of streamlining automation products that simplify services for the residents of North Barrington.

Is data science tech's ‘sexiest job'? Talent wars say so

Is data science tech's ‘sexiest job'? Talent wars say so Murray Webb had been a lackluster student more interested in sports than schoolwork while attending a small Virginia college. Then he transferred to Kennesaw State University in suburban Atlanta to pursue a master's degree in applied statistics and landed four job offers upon graduation. Webb, 33, now earns $160,000 a year targeting health care customers for hospitals and says he is approached weekly by companies and recruiters seeking data scientists. 
Webb is part of a national employment trend that has data scientists at tech companies such as Airbnb and Uber adding the words "I'm hiring" next to their LinkedIn.com profiles. "The word on the street is there's definitely a shortage of people who can do data science," said Daniel Gutierrez, managing editor of the journal insideBIGDATA in Los Angeles. "A lot of people are transitioning from other fields like economics, psychology, mathematics, because they see the field is exploding and there's money to be made." Indeed, it turns out that even in the wake of Facebook's privacy scandal and other big-data blunders, finding people who can turn social-media clicks and user-posted photos into monetizable binary code is among the biggest challenges facing U.S. industry. People with data science bona fides are among the most sought-after professionals in business, with some data science Ph. Ds commanding as much as $300,000 or more from consulting firms. "I like to say we're seeing the employment equivalent of a run on the bank, and it's because everyone's chasing the same talent at the same time," said Jennifer Priestley, a professor of statistics and data science at Kennesaw State University. Job postings for data scientists rose 75 percent from January 2015 to January 2018 at Indeed.com, while job searches for data scientist roles rose 65 percent. A growing specialty is "sentiment analysis," or finding a way to quantify how many tweets are trashing your company or praising it. A typical data scientist job pays about $119,000 at the midpoint of salaries and rises to $168,000 at the 95th percentile, according to staffing agency Robert Half Technology. Andrew Gardner, a senior machine learning manager in Atlanta at IT security firm Symantec, fields at least one "serious inquiry" weekly from recruiters trying to hire him away even as he's trying to fill roles at Symantec. To compete for talent, Gardner is offering more perks including the ability to telecommute: "You have to compete a little differently." Aspirants like Jiong Gao, who is pursuing a master's in data science and analytics at Georgia State University, are rushing to get in while the getting's good. "It's the sexiest job in the 21st century," said a grinning Gao, 25, referencing the title of a 2012 Harvard Business Review article. "For everyone who has a background in computers, statistics and mathematics, it's the hottest job." Companies are begging colleges to let them help with class projects, hoping to get a foot in the door with future data scientists. Atlanta-based Equifax Inc. was one of 11 companies doing data science and prescriptive analytics projects with Cornell University this year, with Equifax offering up voluminous data sets scrubbed of personally identifiable information. The official goal was to determine how customers prioritized paying bills, such as whether someone is more prone to paying a mortgage, car or cell phone bill first, said Chris Yasko, who heads a data science research unit at Equifax. The unstated goal was making a connection with future graduates. "Honey, we have a backlog of companies that want to bring their data into our classroom," said Priestley. "I probably have a conversation with a company every week that wants to do that." Equifax is shortening the hiring process to keep anyone from slipping away. A data science candidate interviewed on a Friday had an offer in hand by the following Monday, said Peter Maynard, senior vice president of global analytics. The company hasn't seen a drop-off in candidate interest despite suffering a data breach that exposed some 146 million people's personal information, the company said. Experts in data science describe a wild West atmosphere right now, with little agreement over how to define the field and scores of people rushing to add "scientist" to their resumes whether or not it's accurate. A common definition calls data science a meshing of statistics, math and computer science, with practitioners using the Python and R programming languages to create algorithms for things like "recommendation engines" — those programs that predict what you may want to buy next based on your recent searches. "It used to be that if you were a mathematician you became a teacher, and then you became a geologist because your knowledge helped find oil, and then you went over to Wall Street," said Jim Sterne, chairman of the Digital Analytics Association. "And now, the quote is, the best minds of our generation are being put to work in advertising."

Judson University's Division of Professional Studies, in partnership with Decision Support Sciences, announced the launch of the nation's first fully applied data science boot camp targeted to corporate education. "The Judson Data Science Bootcamp has a number of critical differentiators," said James A. Libby, CEO of Decision Support Sciences. "We actually went out and asked Fortune 500 and Fortune 2000 firms what they wanted most in a boot camp, and then we built those criteria into the our boot camp." 
Libby said that the JUDS Bootcamp is the first fully applied boot camp that teaches the details of data science by solving real-world corporate problems. The JUDS boot camp is the first nationwide to have simultaneous parallel paths for business professionals, coders, and math/stats professionals, he notes. In another national distinctive, from its inception the boot camp has reserved up to 30 percent of its seats for historically underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines. All students will learn thought-leading content from a team of Ph.D./Educator/Practitioner/Mentors, who collectively have deployed data science-based engagements in 40-plus countries for more than 20 Fortune 500 firms. "Another unique aspect of the JUDS Data Science Bootcamp is that it will allow participants to attend whatever two-week module they desire, from Innovation to Predictive Analytics to Data Visualization to the Data Ecosystem," said Judson University President Gene Crume of the new program offering. "In that sense, it is actually a boot camp of boot camps." The first two cohorts of the JUDS Bootcamp are enrolling participants now. It will launch Sept. 4 and Jan. 8, 2020, at Judson's Elgin campus. Each module of the boot camp, except for the introductory one-week module, is two weeks long and includes 15 hours of hands-on classroom experience with the leading software and platforms in the industry. Professional fees for each module are $2,500, with access to an on-site, advanced laptop provided in the fee structure. "Judson is excited to partner with Decision Support Sciences to offer this new and innovative corporate education program," Crume said. "The JUDS Bootcamp has been created to meet the needs of businesses and industry leaders who need employees that are equipped to make the best data-driven decisions in today's fast-paced and changing environment." Further information regarding the JUDS Bootcamp can be obtained by emailing the bootcamp's enrollment team at juds.bootcamp@judsonu.edu

COD offers foundations of data science certificate
GLEN ELLYN — The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set.
Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining.
"The data scientist has been described as the sexiest job of the 21st century," said Christine Monnier, professor of sociology at College of DuPage. "We are awash in a world of data. We now have the power to run massive computations on computers, resulting in more information than ever before. We live in a new world with facts at our fingertips, and anything we do now generates data. But do we know what to do with it?"
Monnier said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. She said that most existing certificates in this field are very specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on the technical aspects of data processing.
For more information about the Foundations of Data Science certificate, visit www.cod.edu/programs/sociology, email monnier@cod.edu or call (630) 942-2438.

Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining.
"The data scientist has been described as the sexiest job of the 21st century," said Christine Monnier, Professor of Sociology at College of DuPage. "We are awash in a world of data. We now have the power to run massive computations on computers, resulting in more information than ever before. We live in a brand new world with facts at our fingertips, and anything we do now generates data. But do we know what to do with it?"
Monnier said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. A new course, "Introduction to Data Sciences," covers the breadth of the field, while the rest of the curriculum addresses research.
"In ‘Introduction to Research Methods,' students learn that while data can be found anywhere, you must learn how to collect good data," she said. "Students learn statistics in ‘Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences,' and then they either take ‘Introduction to Anthropological Methods,' an anthropology course that focuses on fieldwork, or ‘Introduction to Behavioral Research,' a psychology course that focuses on experimental practices."
Monnier said that most existing certificates in this field are very specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on the technical aspects of data processing.
"We wanted our certificate to be accessible to a broader population," she said. "People who are interested but new to the field can pursue the Foundations of Data Science certificate, and you don't need a background in computer science. You can even take several of the courses to fulfill general education requirements.
"Data analysis skills and research are the ultimate portable skills that have a wide range of applications and are sought after in multiple fields, such as marketing, public health, criminal justice and public policy. President Barak Obama is the first ever president to appoint a U.S. Chief of Data Scientist in his administration. It's a really hot field."
College of DuPage is an accredited community college that serves more than 29,000 students each term. The College, which grants nine associate degrees and more than 170 certificates in 100 areas of study, is the second largest provider of public undergraduate education in Illinois.

Startup makes data science a sport

SAN FRANCISCO — Strange secrets hide in numbers. For instance, an orange used car is least likely to be a lemon.
This particular unexpected finding came to light courtesy of a data jockey who goes by the Internet alias SirGuessalot, who in fact wasn't guessing at all. Instead, he and his partner, PlanetThanet, relied on the hard math skills that make them top contenders in a sport tailor-made for the 21st century: competitive number-crunching.
The used car defect prediction contest is one of dozens hosted by San Francisco online startup Kaggle, whose creators believe they can tap the global geek population's instinct for one-upmanship to mine better answers faster from the world's ever-rising mountain of data.
"Competitions bring together a wide variety of people into a wide variety of problems," said Jeremy Howard, who became Kaggle's president and chief scientist after winning multiple competitions himself. "You get people looking at stuff they'd never look at otherwise."
While the used car contest was fun, Kaggle has its eye on weightier scientific problems. In one contest, an English major who trained himself in data science built a model for predicting the progress of HIV infections in individual patients. In another, a scientist who studies glaciers for a living won a NASA-backed Kaggle competition to measure the shapes of galaxies by mapping the universe's dark matter.
The data problems that need solving are so important that those who find the solutions should be paid like professional athletes, said Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom. By turning data-mining into a crowdsourced contest, he hopes he's created a way to make that happen. Already one of Kaggle's contests offers a multimillion dollar prize.
"We want to see the best data scientists earning more than Tiger Woods," said Goldbloom, who started the company in his native Australia and recently came to San Francisco's South of Market startup haven.
The job market for mathematicians and statisticians has become hot as the sheer volume of data generated by ever faster, cheaper computing resources explodes.
Data storage has become so inexpensive that a 2011 McKinsey and Co. report estimated that a disk drive capable of storing all the world's music would cost about $600. Walmart stores 10 times more data on customer transactions and other parts of its operation than is contained in the entire Library of Congress, according to the same report.
Analyzing the so-called "big data" deluge has become a key task for businesses in an effort to divine everything from which ads online customers will click to how much inventory they need to maintain. Political candidates analyze data to predict voting patterns. Dating websites try to predict ideal mates.
Kaggle competitions focus on creating and testing formulas that can be used to make predictions based on the contents of giant data sets.
The more accurate the formula, the better the chances it will accurately provide answers to complex questions, such as the orange used car.
Goldbloom argues that no matter how many data scientists companies hire, relying on in-house data talent means companies can't know if they're getting the best solution.
In a Kaggle contest, competitors find out as soon as they submit their solutions how they stack up against fellow contestants. They can keep trying for the duration of the typically three-month contests, which are highlighted on the company website.
As the first entries come in, the accuracy of competing models improves by leaps, Goldbloom said. As the contests progress, the improvement curve flattens out. Goldbloom and Howard believe that shows the competitive approach pushes data scientists toward the best solutions within human reach.
"Crowdsourcing allows you to squeeze data dry," Goldbloom said.
Not all competitions are open to all comers, however. About 33,000 contestants have taken part in Kaggle's public competitions, where prize money tends to top out at around $10,000. Winners can get invited to participate in elite private contests, which may include access to sensitive private data sets.
Kaggle's business model depends on deep-pocketed contest sponsors like banks seeking to outdo each other with more lucrative prize purses to attract the best competitors, who themselves in theory could then make their livings off Kaggle competitions alone.
The biggest prize by far open to the public is $3 million offered by the California-based Heritage Provider Network medical group to the data scientist best able to use hospital admission records to predict the profiles of people most likely to end up in the hospital. The next-biggest purse is $100,000 in prizes put up by the Hewlett Foundation for algorithms that can automatically grade student essays.
In its grandest vision of itself, the 11-person company backed by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin will have tens of thousands of competitions running simultaneously. Guilds of data gurus will band together to unleash software that enters competitions automatically. Kaggle becomes not just a way to push humans to perform at their best but to make machines themselves smarter as code-based contestants battle and "learn" from their mistakes.
In this way, Howard said, data competitions become steps along the development of artificial intelligence systems such as self-driving cars.
As for why orange used cars are most likely to be in good shape, the numbers did not hold the answer. One notion was that such a flashy color would only attract car fanatics who would be more likely to take care of their vehicles. That didn't pan out, however, since the least well-kept used cars turned out to be purple.

Oh, to have the talent to be published under a HarperCollins imprint while still in college. Glenbrook North graduate Christina Li, Class of 2017, had her middle-grade novel, "Clues to the Universe" (Quill Tree Books), published on Jan. 12. Her full-time pursuit is as a senior economics major, with a minor in data science, at Stanford University. "I've gotten wonderful responses from readers, from friends who have read it," Li said. 
"It's been really lovely. I've gotten really, really kind notes from people — from kids and parents." At 304 pages in hardcover, "Clues to the Universe" is written for students in third through seventh grade, from about 8 to 12 years old. It's a work of fiction set in 1980 that pairs young protagonists and science class partners Rosalind, or "Ro," and Benjamin, or "Benji," as they become unlikely friends. Each has a father who is absent — one due to death, the other to divorce. The young students face their grief, others' bullying, and work through their differences to find meaning and, yes, piece together clues to some of the biggest questions in the universe. As Li said, "It's about space, friendship and finding your own way in the world." Like Li, the character of Ro is Chinese American. "It was a really joyful experience to bring that experience to the page," said Li, who praised her agent, Jess Regal of Helm Literary Agency, for helping the novel see print. Written during summer breaks from school, Li wrote "Clues to the Universe" over two years before selling it in the summer of 2019. The young author said the seeds of her muse were planted long ago. Among the acknowledgments in "Clues to the Universe" is the Northbrook Public Library and "the infamous eighth grade Wood Oaks Science Fair crew." Li also sourced her own youth. "I was able to reach for that feeling of shyness I had when I was a kid," she said. She's currently working on another middle-grade book set in present-day San Francisco. Though the premise is different, Li said, the story is similar: "figuring out the world around you and growing up and dealing with all the changes." Her vantage point is unique. "There weren't a lot of books that had Asian American characters when I was growing up," Li said. "I think it's just wonderful that I get to write these books and sort of be able to contribute to children's literature in that way." ‘Revolution U' Melissa Novack, half of the Glencoe husband-and-wife team that in late 2020 launched Revolution U — a subscription-based company offering on-demand fitness classes, a healthy habits program, support groups and one-on-one coaching — has written an accompanying book. "Revolution U: change your habits, change your life" guides readers through a series of exercises designed to replace bad habits with beneficial thoughts and behaviors to create a more meaningful life. The 204-page softcover book includes a daily planner in which readers can put this knowledge into action and create their own accountability plan. Novack is a licensed clinical social worker, registered yoga teacher and also a co-founder of True Mind &amp; Body wellness center in Northbrook. Her husband and Revolution U partner Matt Friedman is an Athletics and Fitness Association of America instructor and a certified indoor cycling instructor — in addition to being an attorney. "Revolution U" is available through Amazon and on the Revolution U website, joinrevolutionu.com.

Five candidates are vying for four, 4-year seats on the Roselle Elementary District 12 school board in the April 6, 2021 election. They are incumbents James J. McGowan, Kimberly Duris, Christopher B. Humbert, and Steven Zurek, and newcomer David Franzen. They responded to a Daily Herald questionnaire seeking their thoughts on some of the most pressing issues facing the district. Below are McGowan's responses. In-person early voting with paper ballots begins Feb. 25 at DuPage County Fairgrounds Building 5, 2015 Manchester Road, Wheaton. In-person early voting with touch-screen voting begins March 22 at locations throughout the county. Learn more at www.dupageco.org/earlyvoting/. No candidate is slated to run for the unexpired 2-year term. 
Five candidates for four, 4-year terms Bio City: Roselle Age: 49 Occupation: Finance director at Ingredion Civic involvement: Appointed to Roselle Elementary District 12 board in May 2019, and board vice president (2020 to present); youth volunteer, coach Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I am seeking reelection to the District 12 school board to continue driving this district toward achievement of its stated mission and strategic objectives. It is imperative to continue to capitalize on the momentum created over the past few years as well as leverage continuity and experience of working through the challenges of a pandemic. As a finance professional for more than 25 years, I have a keen interest in maintaining the financial health of District 12. My current roles of vice president and finance committee member at District 12 Board of Education provide an avenue to apply my financial expertise in decision-making processes regarding fiscal matters. This has been especially important in dealing with the pandemic impacts over this school year and will be moving forward, given the state of Illinois' budgetary issues. In addition to financial stewardship of community funding, the district has an exciting agenda made up of curriculum expansion and facility upgrades in support of District 12's mission of keeping students and their academic pursuits at the center of all decisions. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: District 12 school board has had a favorable response to the pandemic. The student population was converted to a full remote learning program in less than two weeks last spring as the pandemic hit our community. Next, a planning committee inclusive of our superintendent, both principals, social workers, nurses and teacher representatives was created to adequately plan a path to in-person learning in August 2020. Guided by data, science and advisement of local health organizations rigorous safety and sanitization protocols were established to protect students, families, teachers and support staff. Throughout the summer, in partnership with the district administration, teachers and families considered many learning models and ultimately a five-day dedicated in-person and a five-day dedicated remote instruction model were offered to keep student progression moving forward. As the year began, teacher devices were upgraded to meet the higher demands of remote learning. District 12 continues to offer both learning models today and through these careful considerations and decisions, we feel the learning loss of students has been minimized. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: The pandemic has clearly impacted district families, students and teachers in a variety of ways. The board, as well as the district administration, provided opportunities for community engagement and feedback regarding the overall response to pandemic impacts. All have been focused on an attempt to establish flexibility with learning models keeping the student's safety and academic progress at the forefront. I view my specific role as listening to members of the community, understanding their perspectives and taking them into account when engaging with my fellow board members to stay true to the district's mission for students as well as the safety protocols in accordance with health experts guidance. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I believe District 12 did continue to adequately serve students throughout the pandemic. This was accomplished via the in-person and remote learning models to address different family situations across both schools. Further, as more students expressed interest in transitioning to in-person learning in second term, alternative spacing decisions were made along with staffing adjustments. Each family in the district was ultimately able to receive their first choice in learning model for both the fall 2020 and spring 2021 term. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: District 12 will continue to offer an in-person model and remote model to address different family desires for student learning this spring. The success of the fall term has resulted in more students moving to in-person learning and the district has been able to accommodate through creative problem-solving regarding space. I believe one of the most important learnings for our district is the benefit of increased engagement from District 12's families. Listening to their ideas, opinions and suggestions has assisted in setting a path to academic progress for students while keeping their health and safety prioritized. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: In accordance with health experts' recommendations, I am supportive of high school sports continuing during the pandemic. Strict adherence to mask wearing, social distancing, and other safety protocols must be followed as laid out by health officials, but I have seen the health and wellness benefits for kids safely participating in athletics during this difficult time.

Illinois aims to boost flagging tech economy with public- private research network

UI says development key to fighting brain drain, racial disparities in private sector SPRINGFIELD — University of Illinois faculty say an ongoing statewide investment in a public-private research network is key to boosting the state's economy. The Discovery Partners Institute, a UI-led research and workforce development hub based in Chicago, is the flagship program of the Illinois Innovation Network that seeks to invest in 15 regional hubs affiliated with the UI system to spur economic growth with state funding. The goal of IIN is to create technology jobs in Illinois and train the state's workforce to fill them. UI representatives testified before the state Senate Higher Education Committee during a subject matter hearing on Monday, claiming that despite Illinois' success in business and STEM education, the state hasn't seen the economic boon to match its academic output. 
"So, broadly, the great thing about Illinois is it is a place where talent gets created, it has tremendous capabilities in creating tech talent," DPI Director Bill Jackson said in his testimony. According to UI's presentation, Illinois is second nationally in computer science graduates and food research and development, fourth in MBA graduates, and fifth in data science graduates. But this hasn't translated to the private sector, leading to a "brain drain" of Illinois-educated tech workers, he said. "But, our issue, right, is we lose that talent," Jackson said. "It goes to the coast, it goes other places and it doesn't stay within the state. We do all the development and we don't get the essence of all that great capability we're building." Illinois is 31st in state economic growth, 46th in private job growth, and 62 percent of computer science graduates leave the state after receiving their degree, according to the university's representatives. On top of that, half of all startups that raise more than $5 million relocate. The UI's tech programs are also not racially equitable. In Chicago, Black residents and Latino residents each make up around 30 percent of the city's population. Cumulatively, they make up 12 percent of Chicago's tech workforce, despite accounting for 60 percent of the general population. In 2019, less than 2 percent of UI system computer and data science graduates were Black, while 5 percent were Latino. The UI representatives contended that this disparity limits the workforce that can be developed to address personnel shortfalls in the tech industry and keeps Illinois behind other states like California and Washington, which have seen similar levels of academic success as Illinois but have reaped larger growth in the private sector. The solution, according to UI's presentation, is continued investment in computer science classes and computer science teachers in public schools zoned for underserved communities. They also promote programs that target Black and Latino K-12 students to establish a pipeline for earning computer and data science degrees at Illinois universities. DPI's Chicago campus, in a development area called The 78, is scheduled to be completed by 2025. Most of the other hubs are situated on public university campuses and in existing structures and are scheduled to be operational over the next few years. Hubs will have an established focus based on their region and the university that houses them. Focus areas include computing and data, food and agriculture, entrepreneurship and environment, and water. An economic impact statement crafted by the Boston Consulting Group in late 2019 claims DPI and IIN will generate $198 billion in economic activity and create or fill 48,000 jobs over the next 10 years. The study says that by the 2029 fiscal year, the project will create or fill more than 9,500 jobs annually, with 4,500 of those going to individuals from underserved backgrounds. State Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, who represents the Champaign area including UI's flagship campus, pressed UI system witnesses on how effective their project would really be in cultivating tech talent in the state. Rose cited a Wall Street Journal article discussing how the world's largest tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are creating 6-month vocational programs that are meant to serve as a competing and equal credential to a 4-year degree. "It seems to me the private marketplace is now going to cannibalize our students," Rose said. "What is this space that DPI is trying to capture where it is a market leader that is not already captured by someone else, not captured by Austin, not captured by Silicon Valley, not captured by Boston or by North Carolina?" Jackson said that while Google and other big tech corporations are filling one gap in the marketplace, DPI will create the capacity for more tech jobs in the state. He also said that its different hubs and focus on creating pipelines in K-12 education allow it to fill multiple market gaps outside of just data science. According to Jackson, Illinois institutions are uniquely situated for developing digital agriculture, transportation logistics and medical research. Rose said he was pleased with the idea of DPI and IIN for boosting Illinois' economy through the technology sector, but he cautioned the state "not to create a wheel that's already been created somewhere else." DPI and IIN were originally approved under former Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017 but had funding delayed over the course of his term. The state released $500 million in state funds for DPI and IIN in February, with another $501 million in nonstate funds being committed to both projects. At the senate committee on Monday, UI system representatives said half of the state funds will go to DPI and the other half to the 14 other hubs in the network. According to UI representatives, only a portion of that money has been distributed for the planning and construction of DPI and five other hubs so far. Those hubs include Eastern Illinois University, Governors State University, Chicago State University, University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. * Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government and distributed to more than 400 newspapers statewide. It is funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.

As the global pandemic reaches new heights across the United States, Americans are likely to be spending even more time at home this winter. With home shoppers already searching for more space in a housing market that has yet to slow down, last week Realtor.com revealed the top suburbs that offer the most affordable space near the nation's 10 largest metros. "These areas just outside of the urban centers of the largest metros offer homebuyers more space for the money. Potential buyers who've been dreaming of more space for work and play don't have to look far to save 29% per square foot on average or get 25%-65% more square footage for the same price as a home closer to downtown," said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. "For a 2,000-square-foot home, this could mean 500-1,300 additional square feet." 
In Illinois, one community made the website's Top Ten. Palos Hills, a Southwest suburb of Chicago, was listed at No. 3 with its median home listing price of $379,000 (single-family homes, 1,800 square feet or larger). That is a cost of $139 per square foot, 24% less per square foot to a comparable home in the city, Realtor.com said. Realtor.com identified the top suburbs that offer the most affordable space by analyzing list prices and median price per square foot for single-family homes within 25 miles of the nation's 10 largest metros. The biggest savings out of the 10 largest metros can be found in Fullerton, California, where homebuyers can find a 2,000-square-foot single family home for $304,000 less, on average, than in nearby Los Angeles. Also offering significant savings is Clark, New Jersey, right outside of New York City, where buyers can save almost a quarter of a million dollars, on average, on a 2,000-square foot home, or get an additional 1,025 square feet for the same budget compared to similar city homes. Palos Hills offers a dense suburban feel with most of its 17,195 residents owning their homes. An array of restaurants, coffee shops and parks — including Bennett Park, where they offer outdoor movies and fishing — make this town a draw for young professionals and retirees, the website says. The area is also home to many young families because of its top-rated school system, which includes Oak Ridge Elementary School — with a GreatSchools rating of 10 out of 10. For those looking for more space, here's where to head (ranked by median listing price): 1) Sicklerville, N.J. Urban Metro: Philadelphia Median Listing Price: $282,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 20% (Suburb: $118 / Urban: $148) Median Income: $89,300 A 30-minute drive southeast of Philadelphia, Sicklerville is a community located within Winslow Township in Camden County, N.J. With a population of 53,099 and 10 constituent neighborhoods, Sicklerville is the 22nd largest community in New Jersey. Sicklerville offers easy access to the outdoors with the New Brooklyn County Park for playing sports and canoeing, and the Winslow Fish and Wildlife Management Area for fishing, hunting and bird watching. 2) Cedar Hill, Texas Urban Metro: Dallas Median Listing Price: $352,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 23% (Suburb: $124 / Urban: $161) Median Income: $76,600 Located within Dallas, Cedar Hill is "the city in a park," and has become a destination for nature enthusiasts, hikers, cyclists, mountain bikers, boaters, campers and adventure competitors. Cedar Hill offers extensive shopping, and a variety of diverse dining options for its 48,463 residents. On average, there are 229 days of sunshine per year in which to enjoy the Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center or Cedar Hill State Park on Joe Pool Lake. The area boasts a strong school system, including Cedar Hill Collegiate Academy (GreatSchools rating 9/10). 3) Palos Hills, Ill. Urban Metro: Chicago Median Listing Price: $379,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 24% (Suburb: $139 / Urban: $184) Median Income: $65,700 Palos Hills is a southwest suburb of Chicago, offering a dense suburban feel with most of its 17,195 residents owning their homes. An array of restaurants, coffee shops and parks -- including Bennett Park, where they offer outdoor movies and fishing -- make this town a draw for young professionals and retirees. The area is also home to many young families due to its top-rated school system, which includes Oak Ridge Elementary School (GreatSchools rating 10/10). 4) Marietta, Ga. Urban Metro: Atlanta Median Listing Price: $440,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 21% (Suburb: $143 / Urban: $181) Median Income: $96,500 A 25-minute drive to Atlanta, Marietta is one of Georgia's most populous cities, with a population of 67,000. The city offers an historic downtown, shops and restaurants, and Glover Park is home to outdoor festivals, concerts, weddings and special events. Marietta Square hosts art strolls, parades and farmers markets. The area boasts a desirable school system which includes Lassiter High School (GreatSchools rating 10/10). 5) Jersey Village, Texas Urban Metro: Houston Median Listing Price: $447,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 36% (Suburb: $126 / Urban: $198) Median Income: $85,400 A suburb of Houston, Jersey Village is located in west-central Harris County, and has a population of 7,620. The area abounds with parks, golf courses, community events, farmers markets and recreational pools. It is also nearby to Traders Village Houston, home of the largest flea market in Texas. 6) Hanover, Mass.

Those of us working through the COVID-19 era may be tiring of video conference calls. It's easy to get Zoomed out, dreading the next "virtual" meeting. But a Zoomer about birding? That's different. 
I couldn't wait to log on for the 2020 Illinois Young Birder Virtual Symposium. The recent Saturday morning confab was time well spent, and ended with a flourish as keynote speaker Kenn Kaufman addressed the kids and took their questions. Kaufman tuned in for the entire symposium, listening to the presentations by some of our state's top young birders and sharing his own perspectives in small doses. There is no bigger fan (and coach) of youth birding than Double K, one of the hobby's rock stars. The symposium is an annual gathering for Illinois Young Birders, a birding club for kids, teens and young adults ages 9 to 18. Administered by the Illinois Ornithological Society, ILYB aims to "foster and ignite a passion for birding among young people, provide community, promote conservation, investigate careers in birding, build positive relationships with other birding groups and, most of all, to have fun!" The fun part is easily achieved through monthly field trips to birding hot spots around the state, primarily in the Chicago region. Of course, ILYB members are usually birding somewhere every weekend. These kids eat, sleep and bird, and their field identification skills often surpass those of their elders. The symposium showcased other skills, including sketching, painting and photography. A slideshow of member artwork and photos played to a soundtrack that included "Birding" by the Swet Shop Boys, a tune worthy of your investigation. Earlier this year, one of the symposium participants, 14-year-old Gracie McMahon from Rockford, was named 2020 Young Birder of the Year by the American Birding Association. Her presentation to ILYB summarized her contest entry, including required elements focusing on conservation and community action. In 2019, Gracie launched a public outreach project in which she hand-painted 52 rocks with different species of birds. Each rock was numbered, with a message on the back: "What bird is this?" along with sandbluff.org, the website of the Sand Bluff Bird Observatory, where Gracie volunteers. The rocks were placed throughout the Rockford area for random people to find. The finders could then go online to watch a video about their bird and receive an invitation to visit Sand Bluff. Gracie and other SBBO volunteers created a short video for all 52 birds. "My project wasn't for people who were already interested in birds," Gracie said. "It was for people who knew nothing about them and weren't aware that birds need our help. Hopefully now they are, and they will continue to expand the birding community." Other symposium presenters were Peter Tolzmann, speaking about the human impact on birds; John Fabrycky on birding in Israel; and Oliver Burrus, sharing insights about data science and "machine learning." Part of Oliver's talk covered iNaturalist, a useful app for helping ID virtually any living thing. Kaufman closed the event with an inspiring talk that reached beyond birding to show how everything in nature is connected. The kids were mesmerized, the way Little Leaguers would be if Anthony Rizzo showed up to their baseball practice. Everyone on the Zoom, it seemed, had read Kaufman's "Kingbird Highway" at least once. "Birds unite us," he said, and "Birds will lead you to everything else in nature." Kaufman reflected on growing up in Indiana and how, at age 6, he learned to put a name on the blackbirds grazing in his yard. They were common grackles and European starlings — not the most exciting "spark birds," he admits, but they were enough. The challenge of finding other birds to identify hooked him on birding. Not surprisingly, as a teen, Kaufman's favorite book was "Wild America," the classic bird-finding travelogue by Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher, published in 1955. A few of the ILYB members had read it as well, which thoroughly impressed me. Kaufman wrapped up his virtual visit with a call to action, encouraging everyone to share their knowledge and passion with others. "We don't have to make people into rabid birders," he said. "If you can get them to care about birds, to have some interest, then they are likely to support bird conservation in the future. We need a lot more people like that." The message resonated, but was hardly necessary. Not with this group. Young birders, the serious ones, are among the hobby's best ambassadors. We need a lot more of them, too. Visit illinoisyoungbirders.org to learn more and perhaps buy a membership ($10) for the future ornithologist in your life. * Jeff Reiter's column appears monthly in Neighbor.

What TV viewers should know about following election night returns

Whether it was CNN beaming holograms of its far-flung correspondents onto the set, or Dan Rather's folksy play-by-play ("This race is shakier than cafeteria Jello"), election night was once an occasion that TV news greeted with giddy, self-promoting flair. Not this year. Amid projected historic turnout — and historic national anxiety — media organizations plan to strike a more somber, deliberate tone. They will contend with staffs dispersed by the coronavirus shutdown, ballot-counting rituals upended by a tsunami of early and mail-in votes, and a polarized climate in which President Donald Trump has attempted to sow doubt about the integrity of the process. In conversations over the past week, top officials at ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and The Associated Press answered our questions about following the election results with them this year. 
* * * Should viewers expect to have a result of the election on Nov. 4? Nobody knows, and news executives say they are prepared for the potential of the count going on well into the next day — or beyond. "Obviously, there's a strong possibility that we won't be able to project the winner" on Tuesday, said James Goldston, ABC News president. News directors say they have run dress rehearsals with their data scientists, statisticians and on-air talent to prepare for every eventuality of how election night might unfold — and now, says CBS News President Susan Zirinsky, "we have to prepare the audience: It may not be over that night, it may take days." Which is why "we have no illusion of going off the air," said Marc Burstein, a senior executive producer at ABC. "We've told everybody not to plan on going home, and then we'll come back to do it on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday." * * * What's changed since the last presidential election? Many television news anchors appeared visibly shocked on election night 2016 as the vote tallies that would propel Donald Trump into the White House rolled in from across the country. That misreading chastened the whole industry. This year, "we aren't going in with any narrative or set of expectations," said Noah Oppenheim, president of NBC News. "We are going to talk about the facts and not get ahead of them." To remind his staff to be cautious and prepared, CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist distributed copies of the testimony news executives gave to Congress when they were called to explain how the television networks got things so wrong in 2000 — the night they called Florida for Gore, then for Bush, then realized it was too close to call. * * * How will the networks get their information on how the vote is going throughout the night? As they have for nearly two decades, the big three broadcast networks and CNN will join as the National Election Pool to share data collected by a firm called Edison Research, which conducts exit polls — via both in-person and phone surveys of people who have already voted — to anticipate the trends within this year's electorate. While "a handful of people at each network" will be permitted to review the exit-poll data during the day, they will not be allowed to report it until 5 p.m. Tuesday, said Edison executive Joe Lenski. Edison also will collect the actual vote tallies from across the country as they are released by local jurisdictions. But Fox News and the AP left the pool after 2016 and have struck out together, hiring a research operation affiliated with the University of Chicago to help them prepare their projections. Arnon Mishkin, head of Fox's decision desk, said his organization was disappointed with 2016's exit polling, which skewed the results by capturing a disproportionate number of younger and college-educated voters — many of whom lean Democratic — and didn't fully probe the voting sentiment of mail-in and early voters. What this means is that for the first time since 1988, you'll see not one but two different polls of the electorate as you flip the channels. * * * How will the huge number of mail-in votes affect election night coverage? In past years, viewers were accustomed to hearing reports about the growing vote tally, tracked by the "percentage of precincts reporting," which enhanced the illusion of a steadily moving horse race. But what goes on in the precincts is more abstract this year, thanks to the large number of mail-in votes — many of which won't be calculated until after the in-person vote. So news executives promise they will explain the vote tally in its full context at every step. "You'll hear about Election Day in-person voting. You will hear about preelection in-person voting. And you will hear about mail-in voting," said David Chalian, CNN's political director. Those distinctions are important, networks say, because each cohort is expected to skew in different directions. Expect to hear television anchors to frame the results in terms of "percentage of the expected vote" instead of the "percentage of precincts reporting." * * * What's this talk about a "red mirage" or a "blue mirage"? Preelection opinion surveys have showed that this year, Democrats have a much greater propensity to vote by mail than Republicans. So depending on when a state plans to tally its mail-in ballots, there could be big swerves in the results throughout the evening. "We have to explain to the viewer what we know about those vote totals, because it could help them understand why a state may appear red initially on the map, but we believe that it may shift blue and that you shouldn't be surprised by that and vice versa," said Chalian. For example, said Fox News's Mishkin, there are two states where people are most likely to "draw inappropriate conclusions" — Florida, which will count its early votes first, possibly making it seem deceptively blue in the early hours, and Pennsylvania, where Election Day votes are counted first, possibly making it seem deceptively red until all the early and mail-in ballots are cast. * * * Why does it even matter what the networks project on election night? In 1980, NBC News used exit polling data to call the state of California for Ronald Reagan early in the evening, and Jimmy Carter conceded the election before the state's polls had closed, which hurt other Democratic candidates in the Pacific time zone when those voters didn't bother to show up. In 2000, based on vote and polling information from a now-abandoned research firm, the networks made the premature botched calls about Florida. The Associated Press was notably alone in saying it could not make a call based on the vote that night. But the contradictory calls on network television helped fuel confusion through the ensuing recount. This year, "being right is of absolute importance, and being first is less so," said Oppenheim. "We have a tremendous responsibility election night and this year more than ever. Everything we report needs to be bulletproof." * * * How will the networks call the race? The anchors may be the voice of authority in delivering the news, but it's not up to them to make the call. Each network relies on an in-house staff typically called a "decision desk" — a cadre of experts in data science and political science who look at historical voting patterns and compare them to real-time data as the vote comes in. They sit apart from the anchors and analysts you see on air. In 2012, when guest commentator Karl Rove disputed Fox's decision to call Ohio for Barack Obama, then-anchor Megyn Kelly had the cameras follow her down the hall to get Mishkin to explain his projections. Mishkin stood his ground and was soon proved right. (All the networks tout the independence of their decision desks, but in 2000, Fox's was run by John Ellis, who spent time on the phone that night sharing observations with his cousins — then-candidate George W. Bush and then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush — and prematurely called Florida for Bush even before the other networks. Fox says that its present-day decision desk doesn't have contact with campaigns.) This year, expect the announcements to come with a dose of math homework, as news organizations plan to show their work. "Every time we call a state for one of the two candidates, we are going to do a small but robust piece of explanatory journalism that we will put out as fast as possible to explain why the AP called that race," said Associated Press Executive Editor Sally Buzbee. "This isn't magic. It's math and analysis." And editors are vowing a "99.5% certainty" behind each call. "We do not call a race until we are absolutely sure that there is no way the trailing candidate can catch up," added Buzbee. One added potential for drama is the somewhat different data that AP and Fox will be working with, apart from the National Election Pool networks, since the two sets of pollsters will work with different sets of questions. "The public will be well-served by the fact that there are two entities conducting that poll," Mishkin said. * * * What will the media do if Trump attempts to declare victory prematurely, as some have speculated he might? Network executives did not explicitly say whether they would air such a speech or not; instead, they promise to report the most accurate news about what's going on, no matter what one of the candidates says. "Our job is to bring facts and context to those facts on election night," said CNN's Chalian. "Votes are facts. If someone declares victory prior to receiving 270 electoral votes and prior to CNN being able to project a winner, we will make sure to make those facts clear to the audience as we do each and every day." * * * How are the networks going to fill all those hours if the vote takes a long time? It's possible that you'll be watching the equivalent of a televised civics class. This year, you can expect the news to go deep on the processes behind mail-in voting, the mechanics of the electoral college, what happens in the case of a tie, the expectations for a peaceful transfer of power and so forth. And as they deliver news, they promise they'll do everything they can to explain where it came from, how they got it, and what it means. "When the hour comes, and the polls close, we are going to characterize every state that has closed: likely, leaning tossup, late-in-the night call," said Zirinsky of CBS. "But what we have to maintain very clearly to the audience is what we know, how we know it. We're educating the public on how we are making this assessment."

Vedic Mathematics India's gift to the world

Vedic Mathematics, an ancient system of mathematics based on sixteen Sanskrit mathematical formulae/sutras Atharva Veda, can be used to solve any mathematical problem whether it's arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or trigonometry mentally! As the sutras were passed down over time, they were lost. However, thankfully, Jagadguru Swami Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha ji Maharaja, the Shankaracharya of Govardhan Mutt in Puri between 1911 and 1918, re- discovered them. 
Vedic Mathematics is more than 10-15 times faster than the conventional mathematics. How do we say this? You can test it yourself. We tested a normal student to calculate 9998 x 9997. He took 85 seconds to compute the answer correctly whereas with the Vedic Method of Multiplication, he could do it in about 5 seconds. Not only did he become more confident in his ability, bubbling with energy and high self-esteem, but he also wanted to solve more problems, showing a remarkable increase in his interest. Twenty years ago, during my final year of engineering, newspaper articles on Vedic Mathematics published by a local newspaper drew my attention. My fascination towards the subject gradually developed and I sought materials so that I could teach myself the subject. In 2010, while I was volunteering for Jeeyar Educational Trust, I volunteered in both technical development as well as in daily activities. When they started a summer camp for the first time in Chicago area, I introduced Vedic Mathematics in addition to their customary activities: shlokas, bhajans, music, and art. Impressed with my work, Shri HH China Jeeyear Swamy, a Hindu spiritual guru, wanted me to write a book on Vedic Mathematics so that he could introduce it to his Vedic students at ashrama. With this great opportunity, I authored the book Vedic Math Made Easy in 2016 and dedicated it to him. I proceeded to design Vedic Math course curriculum, prepare material, and train others through the train-the-trainer program for both Jeeyar Educational Trust and later, North South Foundation. From there, I was able to educate over 1000 students, train more than 100 coaches, conduct classes for 32 different camps and events, and provide services for seven different organizations. I wish to continue my journey of spreading this Divine treasure which India has to offer to the world. Gayathri is an Electronics and Communication engineering grade from OU. She has masters in computer science from UIUC. She has done further studies in Data Science at John Hopkins University. Her passion for STEM has led her to learn subject like Vedic Math. In fact, in her spare time, Gayathri also wrote several articles on Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Embedded Systems.

BERLIN — Scientists say a comparison of 21 developed countries during the start of the coronavirus pandemic shows that those with early lockdowns and well-prepared national health systems avoided large numbers of additional deaths due to the outbreak. In a study published Wednesday by the journal Nature Medicine, researchers used the number of weekly deaths in 19 European countries, New Zealand and Australia over the past decade to estimate how many people would have died from mid-February to May 2020 had the pandemic not happened. The authors, led by Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, then compared the predicted number of deaths to the actual reported figure during that period to determine how many likely occurred due to the pandemic. 
Such models of ‘excess mortality' are commonly used by public health officials to better understand disease outbreaks and the effectiveness of counter-measures. The study found there were about 206,000 excess deaths across the 21 countries during the period, a figure that conforms to independent estimates. In Spain, the number of deaths was 38% higher than would have been expected without the pandemic, while in England and Wales it was 37% higher. Italy, Scotland and Belgium also had significant excess deaths, while in some countries there was no marked change or even — as in the case of Bulgaria — a decrease. While the authors note that there are differences in the compositions of populations, such as age and the prevalence of pre-existing conditions that contribute to mortality rates, government efforts to suppress transmission of the virus and the ability of national health systems to cope with the pandemic also played a role. Amitava Banerjee, a professor of clinical data science at University College London who wasn't involved in the study, said it was well designed and had used standardized methods. He noted that the comparison between death rates in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, where the age of the population and the rates of pre-existing conditions such as obesity are similar, supports the argument that other factors contributed to the differing mortality figures. "Even if vaccines and better treatments for severe (COVID-19) infection are developed, the way to minimise excess deaths is to reduce the infection rate through population level measures," said Banerjee. These include lockdowns, protecting high risk groups,and establishing effective "test, trace and isolate" systems, he said. Germany, which like the United States was not among the 21 countries examined in the study, has seen fewer deaths so far in 2020 than in some recent years, according to the head of the country's disease control agency. While the reasons for this are complex and may take time to fully understand, a decline in hospital infections and the absence of any reported measles cases in Germany since March indicate that social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing play a role. "The measures that were introduced because of COVID have further effects, and they're positive, that much is clear" Lothar Wieler, who heads the Robert Koch Institute, told reporters in Berlin.

Three Democrats and three Green Party candidates are running for three, 6-year seats on the board of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, a government agency responsible for spending more than $1.1 billion annually to perform essential functions in preventing flooding and keeping Cook County's waterways clean. Democrat incumbents Cameron "Cam" Davis of Evanston and Kimberly Neely DuBuclet of Chicago are joined on the ballot by Democrat Eira L. Corral Sepúlveda, the Village Clerk of Hanover Park, and Green Party candidates Troy Hernandez of Chicago, a data scientist and solution engineer; Tammie Vinson of Chicago, a Chicago Public Schools teacher; and Rachel Wales of Oak Lawn, a humane farming adviser and freelance writer. You can learn more about the candidates at camdavis.org, kim4water.com, eira4water.com, troyhernandez.com and mwrd-ilgp.org. Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election for the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you?
 If so, what? What specific professional qualifications do you possess that would make you excel in this office? A. I have a Ph.D. in statistics and have been employed in Chicago's tech sector as an expert in data science, AI, and optimization for the last six years. Additionally, I've volunteered for the Pilsen Environmental Rights and Reform Organization for the last six years and with the Chicago R User Group for the last four years. I believe the most pressing issue facing the MWRD is legalized corruption via campaign contributions. Our uniformly Democratic Board of Commissioners have their campaigns financed by large engineering firms. When you have big engineering firms making big campaign contributions to MWRD candidates, you get big expensive engineering solutions at MWRD. If there were green infrastructure companies handing out campaign contributions, MWRD Commissioners might entertain more economical and efficient solutions like green roofs and permeable pavers. I don't take corporate campaign contributions. My goal is to serve the people of the district, not to leech taxpayers for my campaign contributors like typical Madigan Democrats. For a detailed list of my opponents' questionable campaign contributions, go here: southsideweekly.com/running-clean-water-mwrd-finances-2020/ Q. If you are an incumbent, describe your main contributions. Tell us of any important initiatives you've led. If you are a challenger, what would you bring to the board and what would your priority be? A. One of the questions a citizen frequently asks in voting for their MWRD Board of Commissioners is "Do I need a statistician as part of my Board of Commissioners?" The answer is "Yes!" since a statistician can help to optimize design, analysis and interpretation of results, and drawing conclusions. There is no commissioner on the board with my skills, experience, and knowledge. The board recently authorized a $300k contract to a politically connected vendor to update their website. That's outrageous. For that price, we could've hired a full-time employee for three years! My three priorities are to: 1. Align the incentives of the board with the priorities of the district's taxpayers. We need to reform campaign finance laws for the MWRD. I echo my proposal from six years ago to publicly finance our political campaigns. (Available at troyhernandez.com.) 2. Modernize the MWRD's technology to make the district operate more efficiently. This includes using low-cost sensors, aka an internet-of-things (IoT). 3. Prioritize our investments by performing statistical analyses on IoT data to optimize our investments in gray or green infrastructure. Q. Due to the old infrastructure of a combined sewage system, raw sewage may be released into rivers and the lake during a heavy rain. While efforts such as rain barrels are important, does the district have any long-term plans to address the underlying infrastructure issue? A. There are two underlying infrastructure issues. The first being combined sewers. The second being a lack of green infrastructure. As alluded to in a following question, the MWRD is a billion dollar a year agency with a fraction of the attention that the similarly sized Chicago Police Department is currently receiving. If the MWRD has long-term plans to help separate the sewer systems at large, it's not been widely reported. My thoughts on the matter are these: While approximately half of the municipalities within the district have separated sewer systems, given the scope of legacy investments in combined sewer systems in our other municipalities, it's highly unlikely that it's cost-efficient to replace every combined sewer system. However, it would be reasonable to explore targeted investments where separating the sewers makes sense. Regarding green infrastructure, rain barrels aren't going to be enough. We need to ramp up our investments in green infrastructure. As I write below, Milwaukee is committed to 74 times the amount of green infrastructure compared to Chicago: i.e. the largest combined sewer system in the district. Why does Chicago have to be last so frequently? Q. For years, not one suburban Republican has been elected to the board. Should the board be elected by regional districts? A. Given that Republicans get approximately one-third of the votes in Cook County in single-member district elections like the Senate race, it would seem reasonable to expect that they would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. Similarly, the Green Party wins approximately one-third of the vote in MWRD elections, so it would seem reasonable to expect that we would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. This has not happened. To quote a New York Times article on the subject: "The solution is to elect members through ranked-choice voting (RCV), a process in which voters rank listed candidates in order of preference ... In multimember districts, each party is allowed to run as many candidates as there are seats ... Voters would then vote for three candidates, in order of preference. One more tweak is necessary: Because a successful multimember district is one that fairly represents the different viewpoints in that district, you need to mathematically mandate vote thresholds that will guarantee winners. In a three-member district, each candidate would need to win more than 25 percent to be elected." Q. How do you rate the MWRD on transparency and the public's access to records? If you consider it adequate, please explain why. If you think improvements are needed, please describe them and why they are important. A. With an annual budget of over $1 billion, it's imperative that the public's interests are properly represented. While I'm sure my Democratic opponents will pat themselves on the back for their new inspector general (IG), let's remember that: 1. It was originally a Green Party proposal. 2. Some Democratic MWRD Commissioners tried to stall the appointment process. 3. The IG has already found that four commissioners have used their political email accounts, "to solicit MWRD employees ... for political purposes" in this election cycle. Our tax dollars are literally financing my opponents' campaigns against me. Moreover, in an underappreciated agency like the MWRD, increased transparency would not necessarily improve things. The public's appetite for MWRD information is limited. This is why it's the perfect patronage vehicle. For the average MWRD constituent, the less they have to think about us, the better. The priority should be to elect competent commissioners who will serve the public's interest. That's why I push hard on public campaign financing and RCV. If we can create the proper electoral systems and incentives for our elected officials, these issues take care of themselves. Q. What other issues, if any, are important to you as a candidate for this office? A. With a 1,200 character limit, this needs to be emphasized. Chicagoland has experienced its wettest May ever for the third year in the row! An MWRD engineer was quoted last year (on slate.com) saying, "It's now clear that this 50-year, multibillion-dollar project (Deep Tunnel) will not be sufficient to stop flooding in Chicago." And yet, the Democratic MWRD board continues to prefer big engineering solutions. They go on: "The Deep Tunnel is helpless to empty undersized sewers battling against supersize storms and sprawl ... Even the system's original engineers knew that its potential to solve neighborhood flooding would be limited by local infrastructure." Lastly, "the MWRD has committed to creating just 10 million gallons of green infrastructure capacity under its EPA consent decree. Compare that to ... Milwaukee, [which] now believes its green infrastructure will, by 2035 ... hold up to 740 million gallons of rain where it falls." Our priority should be to reduce flooding in our communities' homes, not to enrich our campaign contributors.

Pro-Trump group pays teens to post online

WASHINGTON — One tweet claimed coronavirus numbers were intentionally inflated, adding, "It's hard to know what to believe." Another warned, "Don't trust Dr. Fauci." A Facebook comment argued that mail-in ballots "will lead to fraud for this election," while an Instagram comment amplified the erroneous claim that 28 million ballots went missing in the past four elections. The messages have been emanating in recent months from the accounts of young people in Arizona seemingly expressing their own views — standing up for President Donald Trump in a battleground state and echoing talking points from his reelection campaign. Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell, however, the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign. 
Teenagers, some of them minors, are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, a prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix, according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls, with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out, at least in part, by humans paid to use their own accounts, though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA's website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the activity. In response to questions from The Post, Twitter on Tuesday suspended at least 20 accounts involved in the activity for "platform manipulation and spam." Facebook also deactivated a number of accounts as part of what the company said is an ongoing investigation. The effort generated thousands of posts this summer on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, according to an examination by The Post and an assessment by an independent specialist in data science. Nearly 4,500 tweets containing identical content that were identified in the analysis probably represent a fraction of the overall output. The monthslong effort by the tax-exempt nonprofit is among the most ambitious domestic influence campaigns uncovered this election cycle, said experts tracking the evolution of deceptive online tactics. "In 2016, there were Macedonian teenagers interfering in the election by running a troll farm and writing salacious articles for money," said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. "In this election, the troll farm is in Phoenix." The effort, Brookie added, illustrates "that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than anything a foreign adversary could do to us." Turning Point Action, whose 26-year-old leader, Wheeling native Charlie Kirk, delivered the opening speech at this year's Republican National Convention, issued a statement from the group's field director defending the social media campaign and saying any comparison to a troll farm was a "gross mischaracterization." "This is sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online, not an anonymous troll farm in Russia," the field director, Austin Smith, said in the statement. He said the operation reflected an attempt by Turning Point Action to maintain its advocacy despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic, which has curtailed many traditional political events. The group declined to make Kirk available for an interview. Turning Point dates to 2012, when Montgomery, retired from a career in marketing, heard Kirk, 18 at the time, deliver a speech at Benedictine University's "Youth Government Day." He called the address "practically Reaganesque," according to a 2015 profile in Crain's Chicago Business newspaper, and urged Kirk, a former Eagle Scout, to put off college in favor of full-time political activism. Kirk became the face of Turning Point, while Montgomery was "the old guy who keeps it all legal," he told the business weekly. The organization amassed prominent and wealthy conservative allies, including Richard Grenell, the former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence, and Foster Friess, who made a fortune in mutual funds and helps bankroll conservative and Christian causes. Both men sit on Turning Point's honorary board. Its standing rose significantly as Trump came to power. Turning Point USA brought in nearly $80,000 in contributions and other funds in the fiscal year ending June 2013, according to IRS filings, a fraction of the $8 million it reported for 2017 and $11 million for 2018. The group, which describes itself as the "largest and fastest-growing youth organization in America," claims to have a presence on more than 2,000 college and high school campuses. It hosts activist conferences and runs an alumni program. It also maintains a "Professor Watchlist" designed to expose instructors who "discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom." Kirk, the group's president and co-founder, has been embraced and promoted by Trump and his family. Speaking at Turning Point USA's Teen Student Action Summit last year, Trump hailed Kirk for building a "movement unlike anything in the history of our nation." A quote attributed to Donald Trump Jr., who has appeared at numerous Turning Point events, features prominently on the group's website: "I'm convinced that the work by Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk will win back the future of America." The online salvo targeted prominent Democratic politicians and news organizations on social media. It mainly took the form of replies to their posts, part of a bid to reorient political conversation. The messages — some of them false and some simply partisan — were parceled out in precise increments as directed by the effort's leaders, according to the people with knowledge of the highly coordinated activity.

Students choose to attend Judson University for many reasons. Rabella Giyo, Class of 2020 and from Hoffman Estates, came to Judson after finishing at a local community college. "I wasn't sure about Judson until I was given the opportunity to meet a professor from my major," Rabella said. 
Now, Professor Leslie Kruser has become her mentor. "She has helped me in reaching my goals, both professionally and academically," Rabella added. Since joining Judson, Rabella has helped start the Judson Accounting Club and has gotten an internship through the Mary T. Wylie Scholarship Program, which gives accounting majors networking opportunities with top accounting firms and provides helpful training tools for passing the CPA exam. Judson University is a thriving Christian liberal-arts institution located conveniently at I-90 and State Road 31 in Elgin, on a pastoral campus framed by Tyler Creek and the Fox River. This fully accredited institution offers more than 60 programs for undergraduate students and graduate programs for architecture, education in literacy, organizational leadership, business administration, human services, clinical mental health counseling and ministry in leadership, as well as a doctorate of education in literacy. The university's adult degree completion program provides associate's and bachelor's programs. This spring the university focused on professional development by launching the nation's first fully applied data science boot camp targeted to corporate education. Judson's Data Science Bootcamp has simultaneous parallel paths for business professionals, coders and math/stats professionals. Judson also launched a new Professional Certification Exam Preparation Program that provides a fast, six-week prep course in the areas of Six Sigma (yellow, green, black belts), quality improvement, project management, production and inventory management, and human resources. To learn more about both new programs, visit JudsonU.edu/bootcamp/datascience and JudsonU.edu/certificateprep, respectively. Students in Judson's Division of Professional Studies can take classes at the Elgin campus, at a Rockford campus and online. Rockford students can also take advantage of the child care and Y memberships available through a partnership with the SwedishAmerican Riverfront YMCA. When Renee Luthe, class of '16 and '18, started her education in Judson's Adult Program, she was just looking for an accelerated course of study to help advance her career and support her family. The result, she says, was transformational. "I thought I was just walking into a degree … but really I was walking into academic, psychological, emotional and spiritual development, which is something that I didn't realize until the end," Luthe says. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in human services in 2016 and a master's in human service administration in December. Judson's programs have been key to the university's recognition as among the top tier of regional colleges in the Midwest as noted by U.S. News and World Report; listed as a military-friendly institution; and named as a Christian College of Distinction in Illinois. Additionally, students participate in many extracurricular activities, including nearly 21 organized sports competing in the NAIA and the CCAC. In 2019, Judson will begin its first football program. With an academically challenging environment and encouraging spiritual community, Judson lives out its vision to "shape lives that shape the world." To learn more about Judson University, visit JudsonU.edu.

Facebook driving huge numbers to the polls

There's been a lot of consternation in recent months about Facebook's impact on politics. If it's not fears of partisan censorship and suppressed trending topics, it's worries about echo chambers or hyper-targeted campaign ads.
But in the upcoming presidential election, at least, Facebook's influence will lie somewhere else: The social network is driving huge numbers of people to the polls — and most of those people are likely to vote Democrat.
This effect is not at all by design. Instead, it's an accident of demographics. Facebook skews both young and female, which means the site's powerful get-out-the-vote campaigns reach more potential voters in the Hillary Clinton camp. The same could be said of Twitter, which over-indexes with people of color. Or Airbnb, which is popular among older, white adults — those statistically most likely to be Republican voters.
In the past week, dozens of technology companies have launched nonpartisan, apolitical voter registration drives, meant to increase civic participation on Election Day. But all could have potent political consequences, even if none of the companies frame them that way.
"Facebook can influence millions of votes by the literal press of a button," said Michael Brand, a professor of data science at Monash University in Australia. "Any decision it now makes regarding the political content of its pages ... is inherently politically loaded."
How loaded, of course, is a matter of conjecture — at least until after Election Day. Many technology companies, including Twitter and Uber, don't release any data on the number or types of voters reached by their campaigns. Other companies, such as the blogging platform Tumblr, report the number of times a get-out-the-vote campaign was shared (in Tumblr's case, 172,500), but not how many people actually registered as a result of it.
Facebook, on the other hand, is fairly unique: The social network has a long history of running voter registration and Election Day prompts, which means we have a good idea how well they work. The site has, for the past several years, displayed an "I Voted" button on Nov. 8, which allows users to notify their friends when they've voted and shows pictures of their friends who have voted already. Last weekend, Facebook also displayed a prominent News Feed banner encouraging users to register with their state board of elections.
In 2010, a team of researchers from the University of California at San Diego, working with Facebook's internal data science team, estimated that the site's "I Voted" button pushed an additional 340,000 voters to the polls. When Facebook added a publicly displayed organ donor option to profiles, organ donor registration rates increased 21-fold.
It's a pattern that seems to be repeating in this election, as well. While only a few states have released data about the registrations they've seen since Facebook began displaying a voting banner in News Feeds earlier this week, the numbers we do have are stunning. The reminder prompted 200,000 registrations in California, 30,000 in Indiana and 25,000 in Kentucky. Connecticut's voter applications increased tenfold over the previous week, and Minnesota saw 27,000 applications in a single day — the largest ever in the state's history.
"I applaud Facebook for joining our efforts to increase voter registration awareness in Georgia," reads a statement by Brian Kemp, the secretary of state of Georgia, where hits to the online voter registration system are up more than 2,000 percent. "I am encouraging all Facebook users to take action now and verify their registration status leading up to this year's historic election."
Kemp is a Republican; his party wouldn't benefit, in all likelihood, if "all Facebook users" heeded his call. Georgia's current active electorate skews white and Republican. Facebook's demographics, on the other hand, favor young people, people of color and women.
According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of female internet users are on Facebook, while only 66 percent of men are. Eighty-two percent of those ages 18 to 29 use the site, as do 75 percent of Hispanics.
That means that any efforts to encourage voter registration through Facebook will necessarily have an outsize impact on those communities, explained Katherine Haenschen, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University who studies digital media and political participation. And while there's more variation here than some pundits would have us believe, those voting blocs generally come out for Democrats.
Haenschen stresses that this shouldn't be political: "It's not Facebook's fault if a candidate fails to be a credible choice for everyone," she said. And of course, people and politics are both fantastically complicated — perhaps Facebook's "voter megaphone" won't have the impact we expect. Brand points out that studies show Republican voters tend to be motivated by consensus, so maybe they'd be more persuaded by a social voting prompt than a Democratic voter would. Or maybe all these people will register, but they'll never show up to vote.
Experiments published in the Journal of Politics in 2015 found that while voter-registration drives do get people signed up, particularly in impoverished areas, they don't change the overall composition of the electorate. That's because, when Election Day rolls around, underrepresented voters — even if they're registered — still don't make it to the polls at the same rates as older, wealthier white people. They face larger structural and procedural obstacles that can't yet be addressed by Facebook.
Still, there's no doubt that Facebook will impact November's election: Its size and power guarantees it, if nothing else does. Brandon Naylor, the communications director for Democracy Works, a nonpartisan voting organization, says efforts like Facebook's are "making democracy more representative." The social network, together with Airbnb, Spotify, Uber, Foursquare and Lyft, has recently partnered with Democracy Works on its "Turbovote Challenge," an ambitious project that hopes to boost turnout to 80 percent by the 2020 presidential election.
"It's not beyond the realm of possibility," Naylor said. "Companies like Facebook have tremendous reach — we believe we're touching every eligible voter who did not turn out in the last election."

Where others see numbers and coding, Kyle Ockerlund sees hope for changing the world one program at a time.
The Huntley High School senior was among 10 Illinois high school students to receive the 2015 Fifty for the Future Award from the Illinois Technology Foundation earlier this year. The program, in its ninth year, recognized the top 60 Illinois technology students, including 50 college students and 10 high school students statewide.
Ockerlund has written two books on computer programming — "Jumpstart Ti Basic" and "Jumpstart Z80 Machine Code," both how-to guides for using programming languages with Texas Instruments graphing calculators — available through Amazon. He gained national attention for research the Experimental Science Society — which he helped found — completed on the effect school bell tone has on student concentration.
His research found a 10 percent decrease in concentration during tests among students exposed to the school's new higher-pitched bell sound compared to students exposed to the previous lower-pitched bell. After presenting his research to administrators, the bell tone was changed back to the low-pitch ring.
Since then, Ockerlund has been involved in other research studies, including a memory lab project examining how students memorize and retain information, more specifically languages.
"The goal is just to get a better understanding of how these things work so the whole process could be optimized for students learning languages," said Ockerlund, 17, of Lake in the Hills.
For two years, Ockerlund has undertaken an independent study in data science where he creates his own curriculum and teaches it to himself using online resources under the guidance of Huntley High computer science teacher Michelle Zietlow, who nominated him for the technology award.
"Last year, I built programs and trained an artificial neural network," he said. "It learned how to play tic-tac-toe all on its own."
Another project involves creating a routing program being used on a trial basis by the Cook County sheriff's office.
"It takes in addresses and creates a travel plan. That program is being used right now in order for them serving various papers and court orders," he said. "The plan is to eventually release it to the county and maybe other counties."
Zietlow said she is amazed by Ockerlund's creativity and motivation to learn about technology, which sets him apart from his peers.
"His understanding of machine learning is way beyond what I understand," she said. "He is just so ambitious and he picks up the material so quickly."
After graduating in May, Ockerlund aims to study data science, data mining and processing, and statistics.
"I could see myself working for a bank to make predictions on loan stability ... working for a hospital identifying cancerous cells in x-ray images," he said.

Sikich names a top 100 firm
NAPERVILLE — Sikich LLP, a professional services firm specializing in accounting, technology and advisory services, has been named a top 100 firm by Accounting Today. Sikich remained steady with a ranking of No. 31 on the 2016 list. Additionally, the firm has been named fourth largest in the Great Lakes region. Top 100 firms are ranked by U.S. revenues and are compiled by analyzing responses to "survey, analysis and growth strategies of firms." Accounting firms across North America complete an in-depth financial and operational survey, where trends are uncovered, growth and profitability metrics are highlighted, personnel levels are evaluated and much more. "Being recognized for this award is especially rewarding, as this prestigious national ranking represents the up and coming firms to watch," CEO Jim Sikich said. "Our dedicated professionals have once again demonstrated outstanding client service, resulting in the increase in top-line revenues and bottom line growth."
SCA partners in Maryland
DEERFIELD — Surgical Care Affiliates will partner with Surgery Center of Chevy Chase, bringing SCA's Maryland locations to six and aligning SCA with 24 more high-quality physicians. Surgery Center of Chevy Chase is a patient focused and physician-led outpatient surgery center. "This investment is part of a continued effort to identify and develop relationships with top tier physicians across Maryland and provide patients with high-quality surgical care at a significantly lower cost." said Tim Buono, group vice president of development for SCA.
COD offers data program
GLEN ELLYN — The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set. Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining. Christine Monnier, professor of sociology at College of DuPage, said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. She said that most existing certificates in this field are specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on technical aspects. Visit cod.edu/programs/sociology, email monnier@cod.edu or call (630) 942-2438.

AI trader? Tech vet launches hedge fund run by artificial intelligence

Babak Hodjat believes humans are too emotional for the stock market. So he's started one of the first hedge funds run completely by artificial intelligence.
"Humans have bias and sensitivities, conscious and unconscious," says Hodjat, a computer scientist who helped lay the groundwork for Apple's Siri. "It's well documented we humans make mistakes. For me, it's scarier to be relying on those human-based intuitions and justifications than relying on purely what the data and statistics are telling you."
Hodjat, with 21 patents to his name, is co-founder and top scientist of Sentient Technologies Inc., a startup that has spent nearly a decade-largely in secret-training an AI system that can scour billions of pieces of data, spot trends, adapt as it learns and make money trading stocks.
The team of technology-industry vets is betting that software responsible for teaching computers to drive cars, beat the world's best poker players and translate languages will give their hedge fund an edge on Wall Street pros.
The walls of Sentient's San Francisco office are dotted with posters for robots-come-alive movies such as "Terminator." Inside a small windowless trading room, the only light emanates from computer screens and a virtual fire on a big-screen TV. Two guys are quietly monitoring the machine's trades-just in case the system needs to be shut down.
"If all hell breaks loose," Hodjat says, "there is a red button."
Sentient won't disclose its performance or many details about the technology, and the jury is out on the wisdom of handing off trading to a machine. While traditional hedge funds including Bridgewater Associates, Point72 and Renaissance Technologies have poured money into advanced technology, many use artificial intelligence to generate ideas-not to control their entire trading operations.
All the same, Sentient, which currently trades only its own money, is being closely watched by the finance and AI communities. The venture capital firm owned by Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, and India's biggest conglomerate, Tata Group, are among backers who have given the company $143 million. (Beyond trading, Sentient's AI system is being applied to a separate e-commerce product.)
Trading is "one of the top 10 places that AI can make a difference," says Nello Cristianini, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Bristol who has been advising Sentient. "A trading algorithm can look at the data, make a decision, act and repeat-you can have full autonomy."
Sentient's team includes veterans of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other technology companies. They're part of a small group in Silicon Valley using expertise in data science and the field of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to try and disrupt financial markets.
AI scientists typically have no interest in working for a hedge fund, says Richard Craib, who started the AI hedge fund Numerai. "But they may want to mess around with data sets." Numerai's system makes trades by aggregating trading algorithms submitted by anonymous contributors who participate in a weekly tournament where prizes are awarded in Bitcoin.
It recently raised $6 million from investors including Howard Morgan, the co-founder of the quant investment management firm Renaissance Technologies. "It's entirely a data science problem," Craib says.
Another company, called Emma, started a hedge fund last year based on an artificial intelligence system that can write news articles.
Hodjat of Sentient spent much of his career focused on the language-detection technology behind smartphone digital assistants. Several employees from his previous company, Dejima, went on to create Apple's Siri. Rather than join, he chose to focus on advances in artificial intelligence. His career goals didn't include finance, but he sees markets as one of the most promising applications for the technology. The vast amounts of publicly available data, along with stronger computers to analyze it for patterns, make the field an ideal fit. "That is the fuel for AI," he says.
Sentient's system is inspired by evolution. According to patents, Sentient has thousands of machines running simultaneously around the world, algorithmically creating what are essentially trillions of virtual traders that it calls "genes."
These genes are tested by giving them hypothetical sums of money to trade in simulated situations created from historical data. The genes that are unsuccessful die off, while those that make money are spliced together with others to create the next generation. Thanks to increases in computing power, Sentient can squeeze 1,800 simulated trading days into a few minutes.
An acceptable trading gene takes a few days and then is used in live trading. Employees set goals such as returns to achieve, risk level and time horizon, and then let the machines go to work. The AI system evolves autonomously as it gains more experiences.
Sentient typically owns a wide-ranging batch of U.S. stocks, trading hundreds of times per day and holding positions for days or weeks. "We didn't impose that on the system," says Jeff Holman, the company's chief investment officer. "The artificial intelligence seems to agree with what you get from human intelligence that it's better to spread your bets and have a more diversified portfolio."
As impressive as Sentient's technology appears, it's hard to know if it works. The company says the AI system is beating internal benchmarks, but won't disclose what those are. It shares little about the data used for the AI's decision-making and isn't profitable. The company plans to bring in outside investors later this year. Holman, a Wall Street veteran who joined last year, said the company is limited on what it can say by U.S. Securities Exchange Commission rules restricting marketing by hedge funds that are raising money. "The platform is solid," he says. "It doesn't look like any other strategy I've seen."
Anthony Ledford, the chief scientist at the $19 billion hedge fund Man AHL in London, warns of putting too much faith in this branch of artificial intelligence without more evidence. Man AHL uses machine learning for a portion of its clients money, and Ledford is encouraged by the results. While the company is exploring a stand-alone machine-learning strategy, he says it's too early to declare success. "There's a lot of hype and promise," Ledford says. "But when you actually ask people how many hundreds of millions dollars they are trading, many of them don't come back with much at all."
Little performance data is available about AI-focused hedge funds. One index that tracks 12 pools that utilize AI as part of its core strategies, called Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, returned 5 percent last year. That's slightly better than the average hedge fund, but trailed the S&P 500.
Tristan Fletcher, who wrote his doctoral thesis on machine learning in financial markets and works for a hedge fund, says investors may be reluctant to turn over their money completely to a machine. "I know how conservative investors are and I know of no one who would put their money in a system that's fully systematic," says Fletcher. "Machine learning isn't a panacea for everything. You need people who have literal thinking."
Chen Chen worked for Sentient until 2012 as an analyst. In August 2011, while the company was still known as Genetic Finance and operating in secret, the system was trading when Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating for the first time, sending markets into turmoil. Chen, now a trader in Hong Kong, went back to review the system's performance for the day and saw it had outperformed the market and made money. He notes that there was no precedent for a U.S. downgrade and wonders how Sentient's AI system made its decisions. "That was a big surprise," he says.

Pandemic sparks Glenbrook South grad to cook up Memory Meals initiative

Chris Tang has taken the term homework to a happy extreme. During his time at Glenbrook South High School, Tang was a member of the school's service-oriented activities, Interact and Key Club, but "never really a leader," he said. "I just participated now and then," he said. 
Since graduating, though, he's kicked his service commitment into overdrive with an initiative he calls "Memory Meals," sparked by the COVID-19 crisis. He's invited people to create packaged breakfasts and drop them off at his house or to pledge money he'll use to make meals for distribution to social service agencies. In a document he sent to fellow members of Glenbrook South's Class of 2020, Tang noted that a breakfast costs all of $1.50 to create. The "meals" part is obvious; "memory" relates to the positive feeling of helping others — "creating this memory for themselves and making a difference," he said. "I think just having all that time in quarantine and hearing all those stories about the struggles people are having, it just felt right, I guess, to create Memory Meals and to support them," Tang said. The Memory Meals effort last month targeted Housing Forward, a Maywood-based nonprofit. Its mission is to transition people in 21 west Cook County communities from "housing crisis to housing stability," according to its website. Tang, with his brothers Ivan and Nathan, has dropped off a week's worth of bagged meals there each Saturday for the past month. This month and in August, his service shifts to Rogers Park. He will be working with the faith-based UR Chicago Alliance and is exploring relationships with other organizations such as the Howard Area Community Center. As of June 29, Memory Meals had packed and donated more than 800 meals. Tang's goal over the summer is 2,020, in honor of Glenbrook South's Class of 2020. "I'd like to thank those that donated to Memory Meals, because their generosity is much appreciated by those who've received it," he said. To participate in Memory Meals, Tang asks people to contact him through email at ctang500@gmail.com or by sending a text message to (847) 736-9456. A Titans boys tennis co-captain whose senior season was canceled by COVID-19, Tang hopes to continue playing club or intramural tennis at Purdue University, where he plans to study computer science and data science. His departure to West Lafayette may not be the end of Memory Meals. "Once I leave I might pitch it to some of the clubs at Glenbrook South, like Interact or Key Club," Tang said. "Just giving it legs to new people and seeing if they want to continue. Nothing's set in stone yet, but I would definitely like for it to become a normal thing, where we continue to support those who need it."

A ‘Great' suburban workplace WESTCHESTER — Automotive sales platform company IAA Inc. has been recognized as a Great Place to Work in the U.S., as well as one of the 2020 Best Workplaces in Chicago. The Great Place to Work certification platform uses data science to quantify the current state of a corporate workplace culture and compares it to the best in the world. 
IAA's certification is based on over one-third of IAA U.S. employees completing an anonymous GPTW survey, which considered various aspects of the IAA work environment and culture, including metrics such as employee satisfaction, benefits and opportunities. "More than 90 percent of the IAA team believes their work directly aligns with the company's mission, reinforcing our combined dedication to organizational clarity and our focus on creating a positive working environment and culture. It is an honor to work alongside such a strong and devoted team each and every day," said John Kett, CEO and president of IAA. Industrial deal in Aurora AURORA — Lee &amp; Associates recently closed a long-term lease for a 43,276-square-foot industrial building located at 3950 Sussex Court in Aurora. Terms of the lease were not announced. Ryan Earley, vice president, with Jeff Galante and Terry Grapenthin, principals at Lee &amp; Associates' Illinois office in Rosemont, represented the tenant, Savoye North America. The owner, Link Industrial Properties, was represented by Transwestern. American Way building sold LIBERTYVILLE — SVN | Chicago Commercial said the American Way Corporate medical office building complex at 1232-1280 American Way in Libertyville has been sold for an undisclosed sum. Albert Lindeman and Nathalie Fisher of SVN | Chicago Commercial represented the out-of-state buyer working closely with them for more than six months. The campuslike setting provided ideal for their existing portfolio. The buyer was motivated to purchase the complex due to the current medical tenant mix occupying the building. "Demand for quality construction with quality tenants are still a high priority," said Lindeman.

An innovation now available at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital holds promise to fight lung cancer. The goal of the Auris Health Monarch Platform, a novel technology that allows minimally invasive access deep inside the lungs to obtain a tissue sample for biopsy, is to enable earlier and more-accurate diagnosis of lung nodules. The technology integrates the latest advancements in robotids, software, data science and endoscopy (the use of small cameras). Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital is among the first hospitals in the United States to install the platform, which was recently cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
"This is a significant new piece of technology that will change the landscape of lung-cancer diagnosis and treatment," said Dr. Benjamin J. Seides, director of Interventional Pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital. "Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy allows us to view and take sample tissue from areas deep in the lung that previously were only accessible via more invasive methods." The Monarch Platform utilizes a familiar controller-like interface that physicians use to navigate the flexible robotic endoscope to the periphery of the lung with improved reach, vision and control. Combining traditional endoscopic views into the lung with computer-assisted navigation based on 3-D models of the patient's own lung anatomy, the Monarch Platform provides physicians with continuous bronchoscope vision throughout the entire procedure. "When a spot on the lung is detected via imaging, patients want to know as quickly as possible if it is serious and what the next steps are," Seides said. "Our goal is to obtain as much diagnostic information as possible in one procedure. For many patients, this technology helps us reduce waiting time for diagnosis and treatment." Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, in part because it has no symptoms in its early stages. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (CT) in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30-pack per year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. CT scanning has been proven to save lives by detecting cancer earlier when it is more treatable and survivable. However, CT screening also picks up many incidental nodules that are of unclear significance, but are nevertheless cause for anxiety in many patients. "Many nodules are in difficult-to-reach locations, so the patient and provider must make the tough choice of undergoing invasive sampling versus monitoring," Seides said. "The Monarch platform makes many of these nodules safe and accessible to biopsy." Invasive sampling procedures include transthoracic needle aspiration, in which a large needle is inserted into the lung tissue using CT or ultrasound guidance. While the procedure is safe, there is a risk of pneumothorax (collapsed lung), bleeding or infection. "With robotic technology we can quickly and safely biopsy difficult-to-reach lung nodules to determine whether or not the nodule is cancerous, while at the same time obtaining staging information, frequently on the same day as the procedure," Seides said. "This is a revolutionary technology that reduces invasiveness while accelerating time to diagnosis and treatment for our patients."

Argonne National Laboratory researcher Prasanna Balaprakash will discuss artificial intelligence's impact on the development of advanced technologies at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in the Jack Turner Conference Center, Student Resource Center Room 2000, at the College of DuPage, 425 Fawell Blvd. in Glen Ellyn. This free event is part of the college's STEMinar series. 
A computer scientist in Argonne's Mathematics and Computer Science Division, with a joint appointment in the Leadership Computing Facility, Balaprakash leads the machine-learning team and co-leads the data-understanding team in the Institute for Resource and Application Productivity through computation, Information and Data Science (RAPIDS) at the laboratory. Based on his work in the lab, Balaprakash said that artificial intelligence and machine learning are fundamentally changing the way scientists do research, as well as our understanding of the world. "In traditional problem solving, we think about the problem and figure out how to solve it," he said. "Similarly, in traditional computing, we have to tell the computer how to solve a problem. When we run into complicated problems that we can't find a solution for, we can be at a loss. With AI, we don't do that. We just give the computer examples through data and the computer learns how to solve the problem." That being said, Balaprakash added that artificial intelligence has potential to greatly benefit humankind. "As computing power becomes cheaper and we continue to generate more and more data, machine learning and artificial intelligence provide unprecedented opportunities to solve problems and create beneficial technologies or treatment plans for diseases like cancer or Alzheimer's." Balaprakash earned his bachelor's degree in computer science engineering from the Periyar University in Salem, India, and his master's degree in computer science from the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg in Germany. He received his Ph.D. in engineering sciences from CoDE-IRIDIA, Université libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium, where he received Marie Curie and F.R.S-FNRS Aspirant fellowships. A recipient of the U.S. Department of Energy 2018 Early Career Award, Balaprakash is a Fellow in the Northwestern-Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering at Northwestern University and holds a Scientist At-Large appointment in the University of Chicago Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering. Seating for his event is limited. Registration is required at www.cod.edu/academics/academic_opportunities/stem/. The STEMinar Series at College of DuPage consists of free talks covering a variety of topics related to science, technology, engineering and math throughout the fall and spring semesters. The goal of STEM at COD is to enhance the quality of STEM instructional and outreach programs and to help current and future students prepare for careers in STEM fields. It offers a broad range of academic programs designed to provide students with the educational background and training needed to successfully pursue an advanced degree or career in STEM.
