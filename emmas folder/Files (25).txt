ABSTRACT
Alumnus Harlan M. Stone is giving $25M for a data science building to further the school's research.
The gifts just keep arriving at the University of Pennsylvania.
After receiving a record $125 million donation this month for the law school from the W.P. Carey Foundation, the university announced on Tuesday that it was picking up $25 million more.
The latest gift comes as a commitment from alumnus Harlan M. Stone to build a new data science building. The center, which will operate under the auspices of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, will be built on an open lot at 34th and Chestnut Streets.
Penn's history in data science reaches back more than 70 years. ENIAC, the world's first electronic general purpose computer, was developed and built on the West Philadelphia campus in 1946.
Vijay Kumar, dean of the engineering school, said the facility "will elevate data science to greater prominence on our campus, fueling Penn Engineering to the forefront of a field that is central to the future of humanity."
Among other things, the new building will house a data science hub for the entire Penn community and research centers that will focus on "bioinspired paradigms" for computing.
"Bio-inspired paradigms" refer to such things as genetic algorithms and neural networks, and the research that's cross-pollinating studies on how brains learn and make decisions and how computer systems might do those things better, said Evan Lerner, spokesman for the engineering department.
A university spokesperson said that a request for proposals would be issued for the building's architectural design. A completion date hasn't been determined.
Harlan Stone, who earned a B.A. in art history and criticism from the college in 1980, is CEO of HMTX Industries, a flooring manufacturer. swood@inquirer.com

ABSTRACT
Different standards for distribution would improve a currently chaotic and unfair system.
The Food and Drug Administration's endorsement of Johnson & Johnson's singledose vaccine is another triumph in the fight against COVID-19. But as more vaccines are approved, still urgently needed is updated federal guidance on how Pennsylvania and other states should determine the number of doses counties need. Many counties are reporting acute vaccine shortages under current protocols, and many of the most vulnerable - often in communities of color and rural areas - are being left behind.
Currently, the only official guidance on vaccine allocation comes from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose recommendations have served as a vital starting point for states in terms of deciding how to allocate their limited supply of the vaccine. But ACIP's model - which relies on a combination of population size and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a tool designed to help government deliver aid in the aftermath of natural disasters, not necessarily pandemics - can be improved by incorporating real clinical data and social determinants of health (SDOH), such as air quality and access to fresh food.
Some officials have overlooked the vital role of county health departments in the vaccine distribution effort. The need for rigorous coordination and planning between states and the federal government is well understood, but the final step in distribution - administering vaccinations - often plays out at the county level. County health departments, 90% of which administer direct immunization services, are the gatekeepers of local health services, typically in charge of ordering the number of doses needed for residents who qualify for the vaccine.
Yet, many states still lack an allocation model that ensures every single county receives enough doses. ACIP recommends allocation based on the size of priority populations in a given county, such as people with significant comorbid conditions. It also suggests reserving a certain percentage of doses for the most vulnerable communities based on SVI. While SVI factors in census data on some important variables that correspond to individual health, such as housing density and status of employment, it does not consider other critical risk factors associated with COVID-19, including social determinants of health.
The result has been the same in many counties nationwide: unfilled orders, backlogged vaccination schedules, and mounting frustration with competition for highly sought-after doses.
My data science company, Cogitativo, just simulated the CDC's ACIP's approach for the 10 most populous states in the U.S. What we found, published in a report titled "No Relief In Sight," was striking: 42% of counties in Pennsylvania will see a dose deficit under the ACIP approach, with a total combined shortage of 264,290 doses.
A more precise way to distribute the vaccine is to use SDOH and real clinical data about the prevalence of certain health conditions to determine the number of doses a county needs. These factors can help health officials make more informed decisions when allocating doses. For example, SDOH - conditions in the environments where people live that directly impact their health - can detect risks for those in underserved communities, such as proximity to local highways or access to groceries. At the same time, claims data from insurers can help highlight where there are higher concentrations of populations dealing with underlying health conditions - such as obesity or diabetes - that could make them more likely to suffer worse health outcomes if exposed to the virus and that need greater doses.
Our analysis of the 10 most populous states found that such an approach could prevent 4.4 million more hospitalizations than the ACIP model would. In Pennsylvania, specifically, the targeted approach would prevent roughly 268,500 more hospitalizations.
The U.S. passing the grim milestone of 500,000 deaths from the virus should serve as a sobering call to action for health officials that there is an urgent need to reach our most vulnerable populations and avoid many of these preventable deaths.
The most ambitious vaccination operation in our nation's history was sure to present many challenges. But more effective coordination between states and counties can better support those who are too often overlooked and underserved. Moving toward a data-based approach that most effectively prioritizes vulnerable populations will ensure that no community in Pennsylvania is left behind.

Flaws in prison virus data; Pa. corrections officials pledge to fix system.

ABSTRACT
Pa. corrections officials pledge to fix system.
HARRISBURG - The Department of Corrections is reporting flawed data to keep inmates, families, and public officials informed about COVID-19 in its prisons, raising questions about the agency's ability to accurately track the extent of the outbreak.
A five-month analysis of prison data by Spotlight PA found large fluctuations in the number of tests administered and unexplained changes to the death count. The findings were confirmed by a California researcher who was also tracking the department's data and had noticed problems.
"It's one thing to have little mistakes here and there, but if it's month after month that there's many data reporting problems, it definitely causes me pause," said Hope Johnson, a data fellow at UCLA's COVID Behind Bars Project, which tracks COVID-19 infections in prisons nationwide.
In an announcement Friday, sent just before this story was published, corrections secretary John Wetzel said he was taking action to fix the problems.
"In our haste to get information out to the public, we put a process in place that involved a single individual pulling data from multiple sources manually every day," Wetzel said, adding, "It's unacceptable to continue in this manner, and I need to both accept responsibility for it, and address it permanently moving forward."
Wetzel said the data dashboard would be taken off-line for 30 days while the department updates its reporting system and prepares for the addition of new data points related to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. He said new, automated reporting would improve the process.
In previous statements to Spotlight PA, department officials had acknowledged flaws in the data, and said they had recently transferred responsibility for tracking infections to their data science experts, who would undertake a thorough evaluation to determine how to improve reporting.
The department declined to comment on why data experts were not originally in charge of tracking, or when the change was made.
"Our Office of Research and Statistics is taking over the daily management of the dashboard and they will be doing a deep dive into what is being collected and how best to communicate that information," a department spokesperson, Maria Bivens, said in an email statement.
National researchers said Pennsylvania officials deserve some credit for, on the whole, being more transparent than prison systems in other states. And those advocating for more prisoner releases said the data is clear enough to know some people would be safer if released.
Others, however, said there has been a double standard about widespread concern and scrutiny of statewide coronavirus data reporting by the Department of Health, but not nearly as much attention paid to problems with data tracked and reported by corrections officials.
"There are certain individuals who don't care that the data is crap," state Sen. Katie Muth (D., Chester) said. "And that they're dying in the prison system. They're fine letting that happen."
The department has documented more than 13,200 positive cases and up to 101 deaths among staff and inmates at its 24 prisons. The Spotlight PA review found tests are being double-counted and disappearing, while deaths are sometimes counted but then erased.
Department officials have said in statements to Spotlight PA and before state lawmakers that removing data was because of errors in duplicate testing. But questions still remain on when and how many prisoners actually had the virus, were negative, or recovered.
In an emailed statement to Spotlight PA in December, Bivens said the numbers published online now indicate the total number of inmates tested, not how many tests were performed. As of Friday, however, the data dashboard said 62,980 inmates have been tested. The department's most recent population data for December said it only housed 40,766 inmates, a discrepancy of nearly 22,000.
Department officials declined to explain the difference.
Bret Bucklen, lead data analyst for the department, said in an interview he couldn't fully make sense of the numbers presented on the department's dashboard, and has been tasked with reviewing some of the information to improve accuracy.
Bucklen has used the department's data to challenge those pushing to release prisoners early through Gov. Tom Wolf's temporary reprieve program. In a Jan. 7 posting to Twitter, he wrote in part, "There are several data points to suggest that in PA prison is safer than the community from COVID."
But Wetzel, the corrections secretary, used the same data earlier this month to advocate to Senate Democrats for the opposite: to release more inmates through legislation in order to create safer distance between inmates inside.
The department has reduced its total prison population by 6,116 since the start of the pandemic through early release or parole. An additional 120 people were released after the governor signed the temporary reprieve program, which fell far short of initial expectations and what some said was needed to safely social distance within prison facilities.
"I thank God, frankly, for a 6,500 inmate reduction, or these numbers of deaths and infections would be significantly worse," Wetzel said at a committee hearing hosted by Senate Democrats. "But let me be very clear, we need further population reduction."
Wetzel said restrictions around reprieve and early parole have increased the ratio of prisoners who are more at risk of dying of the coronavirus, noting that as of now, 47% of the state's inmate population is medically vulnerable.
Sean Damon - the organizing director for Amistad Law Project, a prisoner legal advocacy group - has been compiling prison data in the state and said, "It's startling to see the lack of accountability."
The data problems have compounded concern among families desperate to understand what's happening to their loved ones inside prisons. The department recently doubled down on its policy to not inform family when loved ones get sick or die unless they are listed as the emergency contact on department paperwork, which is often as old as an inmate's prison term.
Sharon Murchison, whose husband and two brothers are incarcerated at SCI Chester and SCI Huntingdon, said she relies on the dashboard for information but is never certain about what's happening.
"I check every chance I get and the information is so incorrect," she said. "I can recall going back and forth and looking at it and going, 'something is off.' "
Other researchers who have been collecting the state's prison infection data said it's better than some other states, but that officials need to rectify inaccuracies and let taxpayers know when and why they do it.
"It just creates a downstream effect of data inaccuracy, " said Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, colead investigator and cofounder for the research consortium the COVID Prison Project. "If they're not noting inaccuracies and giving the public that level of transparency and data standardization, then the data can be really meaningless because it just doesn't make sense."
Still, some lawmakers and advocacy groups say the inaccuracies do not take away from the fact that prisoners are endangered.
Sen. Sharif Street (D., Phila.) has drafted legislation to release people from prison who are medically vulnerable. Despite the data being hard to understand, Street said he wasn't as concerned about accuracy because he knows the severity within the prison system.
"If I needed to be convinced, then that would be true, but I don't need to be convinced," Street said.
And other groups, like the Pennsylvania Prison Society, the state's unofficial ombudsman for prisoners and their families, align with Street's view.
"I do feel like day-to-day, week-to-week, the DOC is giving us information that allows us to understand the spread and the degree of the spread," said Claire Shubik-Richards, executive director of the Pennsylvania Prison Society. "If I was a medical provider, this data would not be helpful."

'New normal' in tech means grappling with racism and diversity

Following weeks of civil unrest across the country, America is having a reckoning over discrimination. The "new normal" that we are entering has no space for racism, gender inequality, homophobia, or the lack of diversity at the workplace.
As of 2019, the data and tech industry consisted of only 30% women. There is a significant gender gap in tech and data science leadership roles and technical roles. If we were to conduct a root cause analysis of this issue, three significant reasons come out. First, Black and Latino high school/middle school girls lack access to STEM subjects. Secondly, data science is a fairly new field that lacks representation. Lastly, there are very few university and government programs that provide resources and training opportunities to a wider audience.
Diversity improves employee engagement, increases company confidence, and attracts new talent. A more diverse organization will be successful in the long run. In today's world, diversity includes, but is not limited to, gender, race, sex, demographic, and economics.
Here are four steps any community can take to improve their diversity index.
Be a part of a grassroots movement
The majority of the work happens at a local community level. As an individual, you can volunteer for STEM-focused nonprofits like TechGirlz and Philly Tech Sistas by supporting their educational programs. I cannot think of any bigger resource that is untapped right now than our vast talent pool. If you are an organization, I encourage you to pledge to hire a diverse talent pool from community colleges and high schools. Recently, Vanguard announced its efforts to support historically Black colleges and universities that are disproportionately affected due to COVID-19.
Increase universities and government agencies programs
I encourage local universities and government agencies to start building partnerships with these grassroots nonprofits focused on data and tech. I understand that social justice will take time and some heavy resources, but I would like us to focus on a simpler task at hand - giving them a sneak peek into the world of STEM. Temple University and Penn have distinguished community STEM programs that provide education and opportunities.
Provide mentorship services
Throughout my career, I have relied heavily on having strong mentors who helped me get a strong start to my career and provided honest feedback.
Some of us are shy to approach a mentor. Blame this on the lack of opportunities, imposter syndrome, or the lack of confidence - it is clear that we need a network of mentors who are supporting every group. It is about time representation of minority groups becomes a norm within the tech world.
If there is anything that you can do right now, at this moment, then provide mentorship to these grassroots communities. Women in Data's founding membership offers the opportunity to provide free mentorship service that will connect professional women to mentees.
The Women in Data program offers a safe space if you are someone who is anxious about reaching out to mentors. As a regional sponsorship lead for Women in Data, I had the privilege to help students find the correct set of mentors.
Entering the virtual age
This "new normal" is focused heavily on technology and data. The future of the workplace will rely on tech experts and data specialists. It is our duty to pave the path for the next generation of a diversified workforce. The starting line of the race must be equal for it to be fair. There are free educational resources, like Women in Data's exclusive membership, that provide access to virtual study groups where the community can learn and network at the same time.
Partnering with local nonprofits focused on increasing data literacy and diversity is a step in the right direction. Creating a career pipeline for diverse groups within the community will be the goal.
Rajvi Mehta is an advanced data analyst at Vanguard and the sponsorship/regional sponsorship lead at Women in Data. She moved to Philadelphia in 2017 after completing her masters in quantitative finance at the University of Buffalo.

Psychological impact hitting home; Allentown, Reading, and Camden are among most vulnerable U.S. cities for mental health effects.

ABSTRACT
Allentown, Reading, and Camden are among most vulnerable U.S. cities for mental health effects.
Camden, Allentown, and Reading have been identified as cities where COVID-19 vulnerability and poor mental health overlap, according to a new report published this month by Mental Health America and the Surgo Foundation, a health nonprofit focused on data science.
Worsening mental health due to COVID-19 has become an area of serious concern to health officials. A recent report by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that 40% of Americans surveyed said they struggled with at least one adverse mental health condition during the pandemic. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were the most commonly reported.
The new report aims to identify cities and geographical areas that had a high prevalence of poor mental health before the pandemic, according to CDC data, and therefore are more likely to be negatively affected by the stresses of COVID-19. In Camden, the report found that 84% of residents live in "highly COVID-vulnerable neighborhoods" with high rates of poor mental health. In Reading and Allentown, those percentages were 78% and 61%, respectively. Other cities highlighted in the report include Detroit, Trenton, and Syracuse, N.Y.
"The cities don't have a ton in common, but there is a little bit of a concentration in the Rust Belt," said Christine Campigotto, program manager at Surgo who led the analysis. "A lot of that concentration is driven by poor mental health rates in quite a few cities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Upstate New York. But it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean that these cities will have higher case rates and death rates, or that the virus itself would spread more quickly in those communities."
The report analyzed data from the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI), a tool developed by Surgo to identify communities that are less likely to overcome a coronavirus outbreak due to poor socioeconomic and health factors. The CCVI is modeled on the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index, which aggregates four factors - socioeconomic status; household composition; disability; language and minority status, and housing type - to determine which populations are most at risk during a public health crisis. Surgo researchers added two additional factors specific to COVID-19 risk.
"The first theme we added was a number of indicators around epidemiological vulnerability, things like underlying chronic conditions that are comorbidities with COVID-19, such as obesity, or places where there are high annual deaths from the seasonal flu," Campigotto said. "The second theme involved access and health-care systems, so this included data on how much money is spent per person in health care, the number of ICU beds, and health insurance rates."
The data from the CCVI were then combined with data from Mental Health America's national rankings on how much access to mental health care exists within a state to determine the cities that were the most vulnerable.
Theresa Nguyen, program officer and vice president of research and innovation at Mental Health America, said, "Insurance and the shortage of providers are the two largest barriers."
"We often see that people want mental health care, but they can't access it. It's not stigma. It's not necessarily fear," Nguyen said. "The infrastructure either doesn't exist, or if it does exist, it's so challenging to navigate that people choose not to."
In Pennsylvania alone, more than 1.7 million people live in areas with a shortage of mental health care providers, according to KFF, a health-policy nonprofit. The Association of American Medical Colleges also estimates that the United States may be facing a shortage of up to 15,600 psychiatrists by 2025.
One way to address this problem would be to build up the workforce in mental health by incentivizing a pipeline, Nguyen said.
"We need more funding to help people choose to go into mental health as a growing field," she said. "From a policy perspective, we need to look at the reimbursement rate for mental health services and make sure they're on par with physical health. Our problem right now is that there's so much need and so few providers, and because insurance companies don't incentivize people to take insurance, we lose out access."
Campigotto stressed that the report was not a prediction of an unavoidable mental health crisis.
"This is not a foregone conclusion, by any means," she said. "If we take care to slow the spread of the pandemic in the first place and improve access to mental health care because we acknowledge that there will be a period of grief and difficulty for people for years to come, there's still a lot we can do to prevent this." bao@inquirer.com bethanyao

Humana buys Enclara; NeuroFlow raises $7.5M

Two Philadelphia-based health-care tech firms announced big investments from out-of-town firms Monday.
Humana Inc., one of the largest U.S. health insurance companies, said it has agreed to buy Center City-based Enclara Healthcare, whose software speeds prescription drugs to nearly 100,000 hospice residents and other chronic-care patients each day. Enclara employs 800, half of them in Philadelphia and elsewhere in Pennsylvania.
Sellers are Enclara founder Andy Horowitz, members of his management team, and Penn medical school and Wharton School graduate Mitchell Blutt's New York investment firm, Consonance Capital Partners.
Humana won't say what it will pay, noting only that the deal would have no "material" impact on the Louisville, Ky.-based buyer, which expects to collect profits of more than $2.5 billion on sales of over $60 billion this year. Humana will "leverage" Enclara to expand its own services, said Humana Pharmacy Solutions president Scott Greenwell in a statement.
"There will be no impact to Enclara's employees, operations, and business," said Humana spokesperson Marina Renneke. "Humana plans to integrate Enclara into its broader pharmacy and strategies through a multi-stage approach over the next two years." She declined to estimate how many people now work for Enclara's several business units.
The Enclara team headed by Horowitz, a lawyer, and Stephen Phenneger, a La Salle University grad and veteran healthcare investment accountant who serves as Enclara's chief financial officer, did "an outstanding job growing the company organically and through acquisitions," said Consonance cofounder Benjamin Edmands in a statement.
Horowitz, in turn, praised Consonance as "a critical partner throughout Enclara's evolution over the past five years from a small hospice-focused pharmacy into a national full-service specialized pharmacy management platform. We look forward to the next chapter for Enclara under Humana's ownership."
The deal is expected to close next spring. Humana was advised by Centerview Partners and law firm Crowell & Moring; Enclara was advised by Evercore Inc.
Separately, NeuroFlow, a 28-person, Philadelphia-based behavioral health medical software start-up whose clients include Jefferson Health, says it has raised $7.5 million in its first venture capital fund-raising round, led by San Francisco-based Builders VC, and also including Dreamit Ventures, Spring Point Partners, Penn-based Red & Blue Ventures, and AWT Private Investments.
"In the sea of mental health [software], NeuroFlow stood out to us as being the one that was most 'clinical grade,' " said Builders VC partner Mark H. Goldstein in a statement.
NeuroFlow will use the money to hire more marketing and data science people and boost its "product integrations and data science," working with "hundreds of providers to support the overall health of tens of thousands of individuals," said NeuroFlow chief executive Chris Molaro in a statement. "We're helping patients get better faster."

The 2020 Census has been challenging to conduct amid coronavirus-related delays and legal and legislative battles. But as the count enters its final week of a truncated schedule, it has been dealt an unforeseen and possibly critical blow: Hurricanes and wildfires in large swaths of the country are making it harder to implement the count, potentially creating a vicious cycle of inaccurate data that could hamper future disaster relief efforts.
"It's the perfect storm," said Ditas Katague, director of the California Complete Count - Census 2020 Office, an organization working to ensure a complete count of the hardest-to-count Californians. "And if you add the shortening of the time, it adds greater potential for inaccuracy."
Four of the Southeastern states in the path of September's storm systems - Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina - also happen to be among the five states that, as of last weekend, had counted fewer than 91 percent of households, the lowest response rates in the nation, according to an analysis by the data science company Civis Analytics and the nonprofit group National Conference on Citizenship (NCoC).
In California, Oregon and Washington state, where enumerators still need to complete the final couple of percentage points of households, fires have ravaged the landscape, directly affecting tens of thousands of people and engulfing most of the states with unhealthy air.
The bureau aims to enumerate at least 99 percent of households; as of Monday, it had counted 95.4 percent, with just over a week to go before the count is set to end. In the states affected by storms, which also include Texas, nearly 2.7 million households remained uncounted as of last weekend. As of last Sunday night, about 6.39 million residents were estimated to be affected by Tropical Depression Sally, and on Monday, 13.9 million were estimated to be affected by Tropical Storm Beta, according to an emergency management map maintained by the Census Bureau.
A final 2020 Census that is considered inaccurate could affect response to future natural disasters, NCoC senior fellow Denice Ross said. "You won't know the right number of buses to help people evacuate from a hurricane or a fire, you won't know how many seats you need, or how many beds do you need to set up at a shelter."
The Southeastern states hit by storms have not only some of the country's lowest response rates but also some of the highest levels of coronavirus cases per capita, which could also make householders more reluctant to open the door to enumerators.
The natural disasters have struck at an already uncertain time for the census. The pandemic, which hit just as survey forms were appearing in people's mailboxes, delayed operations originally scheduled to end in July. Respondents are supposed to fill out the survey based on their whereabouts on April 1, but gathering accurate data becomes harder the more time passes after that date.
Several lawsuits are challenging the Trump administration's sudden announcement that it would end the count on Sept. 30 rather than Oct. 31 as planned.
Inaccuracies in the count can stem not only from the shortened data collection time but also from a truncated timeline for quality checks and analysis. The government's accelerated "replan," announced in August, reduced the post-count operations from six months to three and eliminated reviews with state demographers designed to help identify people who were either missed or counted more than once.
Testifying during the summer before the House Oversight Committee, former Census Bureau director Robert Groves urged the bureau to release more information, including "process indicators" such as initial response rates, proxy reporting rates, and percentages of people with usable data; comparisons with population estimates from demographic analysis; and initial field data from the post-enumeration survey.
"Credibility requires transparency," he said. "The sooner the country can see multiple indicators of 2020 Census quality, the sooner the use case for the census can be made."

'Troll farms' rebuked by Big Tech; Pro-Trump youth group enlists teens in secretive campaign condemned by Twitter, Facebook

ABSTRACT
Pro-Trump youth group enlists teens in secretive campaign condemned by Twitter, Facebook
One tweet claimed coronavirus numbers were intentionally inflated, adding, "It's hard to know what to believe." Another warned, "Don't trust Dr. Fauci."
The messages have been emanating in recent months from the accounts of young people in Arizona seemingly expressing their own views - standing up for President Trump in a battleground state and echoing talking points from his reelection campaign.
Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell, however, the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign.
Teenagers, some of them minors, are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, the prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix, according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. Their descriptions were confirmed by detailed notes from relatives of one of the teenagers who recorded conversations with him about the efforts.
The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls, with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out, at least in part, by humans paid to use their own accounts, though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-today activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA's website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the activity.
In response to questions from The Post, Twitter on Tuesday suspended at least 20 accounts involved in the activity for "platform manipulation and spam." Facebook also removed a number of accounts as part of what the company said is an ongoing investigation.
The effort generated thousands of posts this summer on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, according to an examination by The Post and an assessment by an independent specialist in data science. Nearly 4,500 tweets containing identical content that were identified in the analysis probably represent a fraction of the overall output.
The months-long effort by the tax-exempt nonprofit is among the most ambitious domestic influence campaigns uncovered this election cycle, said experts tracking the evolution of deceptive online tactics.
"In 2016, there were Macedonian teenagers interfering in the election by running a troll farm and writing salacious articles for money," said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. "In this election, the troll farm is in Phoenix."
The effort, Brookie added, illustrates "that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than anything a foreign adversary could do to us."
Turning Point Action, whose 26-year-old leader, Charlie Kirk, delivered the opening speech at this year's Republican National Convention, issued a statement from the group's field director defending the social media campaign and saying any comparison to a troll farm was a "gross mischaracterization."
"This is sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online, not an anonymous troll farm in Russia," the field director, Austin Smith, said in the statement.
The group declined to make Kirk available for an interview.
The online salvo targeted prominent Democratic politicians and news organizations on social media. It mainly took the form of replies to their posts, part of a bid to reorient political conversation.
The messages - some of them false and some simply partisan - were parceled out in precise increments as directed by the effort's leaders, according to the people with knowledge of the highly coordinated activity, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy of minors carrying out the work.
One parent of two teenagers involved in the effort, Robert Jason Noonan, said his 16- and 17-year-old daughters were being paid by Turning Point to push "conservative points of view and values" on social media. He said they have been working with the group since about June, adding in an interview, "The job is theirs until they want to quit or until the election."
Four years ago, the Kremlinbacked Internet Research Agency amplified Turning Point's rightwing memes as part of Moscow's sweeping interference aimed at boosting Trump, according to expert assessments prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee. One report pointed specifically to the use of Turning Point content as evidence of Russia's "deep knowledge of American culture, media, and influencers."
Now, some technology industry experts contend that the effort this year by Turning Point shows how domestic groups are not just producing eye-catching online material but also increasingly using social media to spread it in disruptive or misleading ways.
"It sounds like the Russians, but instead coming from Americans," said Jacob Ratkiewicz, a software engineer at Google whose academic research, as a PhD student at Indiana University at Bloomington, addressed the political abuse of social media.
Noonan, 46, said "some of the comments may go too far" but cast the activity as a response to similar exaggerations by Democrats.
"We are Trump supporters, but one of the things my wife and I have been very consistent on is to always understand both sides and make decisions from there," he said.

Multimillion-dollar gifts for schools; 76ers co-owner gives $10 million to Wharton; a banking veteran donates $5 million to Bryn Mawr.

ABSTRACT
76ers co-owner gives $10 million to Wharton; a banking veteran donates $5 million to Bryn Mawr.
The Wharton School of Business and Bryn Mawr College each announced this week they had received multimillion-dollar gifts to launch innovative academic programs.
The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania announced a $10 million gift from billionaire alumnus and Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Josh Harris, who graduated in 1986, and his wife, Marjorie Harris.
Bryn Mawr College announced it had received a $5 million gift from alumna Betsy Zubrow Cohen, who graduated in 1963.
Josh Harris is the cofounder of Apollo Global Management, a private equity giant that manages about $250 billion in assets.
The Harris gift will go to establish the Joshua J. Harris Alternative Investments Program, which is aimed at creating opportunities for Wharton students to learn about alternative investments. Alternative investments are nonconventional holdings - meaning assets other than stocks, bonds, and real estate. In particular, the money would help establish an effort to create expertise in blockchain, the online ledger technology that powers many of the leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
"As an alternative-investments trailblazer, Josh is a role model for our students and an incredible friend to the Wharton School," said dean Geoffrey Garrett.
In October, Josh Harris' partner at Apollo Global, fellow Wharton alumnus Marc Rowan, donated $50 million to the school.
At Bryn Mawr, Cohen's gift will provide seed money to "embed data science throughout the curriculum," said college president Kim Cassidy.
The matriarch of the Cohen financial and energy empire, Betsy Cohen cofounded Jefferson Bank before selling it to create one of the nation's first successful online banks, the Wilmington-based Ban-corp. Cohen, who was a math major before focusing on philosophy, said fluency in data and data analytics has become a necessary skill for any student of the humanities.
"Data analytics is not a subject as much as it is a platform for learning," Cohen said. "It's not something that has been traditionally offered by small liberal arts colleges. But my thinking was it should be because it's become a universal language. It may not have been true 50 years ago, but it's true today.
"We are hoping this will be a transformative gift for the college," she said.
With a handle on data analytics, students of the most arcane subjects can gather facts quickly, Cohen said. "And that could reveal new insights."
"If one were doing a study of a Greek text - say a philological examination of how a particular word was used - having analytics as a tool might show you patterns that haven't been previously revealed," Cohen said.
Cohen, who retired from Ban-corp in 2014, now operates on the equity side and knows the power of data science. Now the chairwoman of FinTech Acquisition Corp III, Cohen uses analytics extensively to buy, sell, and take financial technology companies public. samwood@phillynews.com

Cities using more data, but risks are clear; Anything created by people is subject to limitations, including racial or sexual bias. Users are being taught to be skeptical.

ABSTRACT
Anything created by people is subject to limitations, including racial or sexual bias. Users are being taught to be skeptical.
With one million properties and limited staff, New York City needs to be selective about the buildings it inspects for fire risk. So it relies heavily on data - including on past fires and building traits - to choose.
Chicago uses data to identify which children are most at risk of lead poisoning and how officials could intervene.
And in Philadelphia, Mayor Kenney's administration has emphasized evidence-based decision-making. Last year, the city launched GovLabPHL, a multiagency collaboration that uses studies of human behavior to shape how the city interacts with residents.
Municipal records are now digitized and easier to share among departments, so Philadelphia and other cities are centralizing data that agencies historically kept to themselves.
But as governments increasingly use that data to operate more efficiently, researchers and analysts caution that computer-based decision-making isn't perfect and must be used with discretion.
In 2016, a ProPublica investigation explained how software used across the country to predict future criminal behavior was biased against black people. In a data analysis of a Florida county, the software falsely labeled black defendants as likely to re-offend at nearly twice the rate it did for white defendants. The same year, the Seattle Times reported on a flaw in LinkedIn's search feature that suggested male names when users searched for female names.
"Data science is here to stay. It holds tremendous promise to improve things," said Julia Stoyanovich, an assistant professor at New York University and former assistant professor in ethical data management at Drexel University. But policymakers, she said, need to use it responsibly.
"The first thing we need to teach people is to be skeptical about technology," she said.
Data-review boards, tool kits, and software that cities, universities, and data analysts are starting to develop are steps in the right direction to spur policymakers to think critically about data, researchers said.
Philadelphia is setting standards for its departments' data collection and quality. Mark Wheeler, Philadelphia's chief information officer in the Office of Innovation and Technology, said hearing Stoyanovich speak at a seminar this spring was "eyeopening" and helped inform the city's current job listing for its next chief data officer.
How do municipal governments use data to make decisions?
Governments have long been using data and algorithms -series of instructions a human can give to a computing program, also called automated decision systems - mostly for "counting" tasks, such as processing payroll and tracking 311 calls. But in recent years, governments have started to use data and algorithms to deliver services, said Rayid Ghani, director of the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago.
New York uses taxi trip data to decide how to regulate the fleet. Mapping data tell first responders the fastest ways to get to an emergency.
Philadelphia's litter index maps trash hot spots to spur cleanups.
Philadelphia police analyzed data to launch a youth "diversion" program, in which students are often placed in after-school programs instead of jails for certain low-level crimes. In the first year, student arrests dropped by half.
During the administration of Charles H. Ramsey, Police Commissioner Richard Ross' predecessor, the department realized it could use data for more than crime analysis and statistics when it tested the effect of foot patrols and saw a drop in crime, said Kevin Thomas, the Police Department's director of research and analysis.
The department considered buying predictive algorithm software and tested a program that suggested where to put patrol vehicles, but officials didn't see results, Thomas said. Such tools have not added value beyond what the department's analytical teams can provide, he said.
"It's not that I believe there is no place for" artificial intelligence, Thomas said. "What we've examined so far has been underwhelming in terms of applications toward crime incidents."
How can data use go wrong?
"I think there is a lot of goodwill on the side of city government to try their best to use data responsibly," Stoyanovich said. "But these problems are very challenging."
For example, data collected for one purpose may throw off results if used for a different purpose. Despite conventional wisdom, having more data doesn't necessarily mean better outcomes. Policymakers need quality and the right type of data.
While efficiency is often the goal for municipal officials pushing for databased decision-making, Ghani said, "it sometimes leads to disproportionate impact for different types of people."
Andrew Nicklin, director of data practices at the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University, said the ProPublica story about racial discrimination in predictive crime software spurred him to work with other researchers on a data tool kit to help government officials avoid unintended consequences.
According to the tool kit's authors, "algorithms can harbor biases against disadvantaged groups or reinforce structural discrimination."
"We started from the assumption that all people are biased, and therefore all data are biased, and therefore all algorithms are biased," Nicklin said. "Algorithms are created by people. People have fallibility. That's OK. We just have to acknowledge that. We just have to have a conversation about it."
How are governments and researchers working to cut down on discriminatory outcomes?
Cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Cambridge, Mass., are turning to transparency as one solution. The cities' open data websites invite the public to examine information and cities' methods of interpreting it.
In May, New York convened a task force to study how the city uses data. By next December, its 18 members will submit recommendations on how the city should assess its automated decision-making "to ensure equity and opportunity," according to the mayor's office.
Research centers such as the AI Now Institute at New York University study social implications of artificial intelligence.
University researchers and data scientists are writing or updating codes of conduct, including "Community Principles on Ethical Data Practices." One principle states: "Acknowledge and mitigate unfair bias" by sharing data processing methods and disclosing bias in algorithms.
In Cambridge, city staff and residents came together three years ago to form the Open Data Review Board, which recommends policies to govern data sets.
"As we start using more and more algorithms, we're going to need oversight committees like the Open Data Review Board to be able to have the 35,000-foot view over this emerging field and understand how the pieces are working together," said Josh Wolff, the city's open-data program director.
In September, Nicklin, the Johns Hopkins researcher; along with researchers in San Francisco, Data Community DC, and Harvard University's Data-Smart City Solutions, released an "Ethics and Algorithms Toolkit." It walks people through questions to consider to minimize ethical risks. Ghani and his fellow researchers at the University of Chicago this year released software cities can use to audit their data to look for biases.
What are some questions policymakers should ask about data and its use?
Officials should consider how and for what purpose data was collected and whether that aligns with how they are using the data, researchers said.
Some other questions they suggest policymakers ask: How can we evaluate the accuracy and equity of our data systems? How can we reduce opportunities for bias in the data? Are knowledgeable teams in place to work with the data?
"It's overwhelming for us in computer science as well," said Stoyanovich, a member of New York's Automated Decision Systems Task Force, "because there's not just one way to do things correctly." mbond@phillynews.com

Vaccine czar is 'good news'; FORMER GLAXO EXEC: Moncef Slaoui a good pick for tough job, Penn scientist says.

ABSTRACT
FORMER GLAXO EXEC: Moncef Slaoui a good pick for tough job, Penn scientist says.
Glen Gaulton, a top virologist at Penn Medicine, was at breakfast last Friday when his old Harvard lab partner flashed onto the kitchen TV along with President Donald Trump.
There was Trump introducing Moncef M. Slaoui as "Operation Warp Speed's chief scientist," assigning the Gladwyne resident the highstakes task of finding a coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year - a timeline viewed skeptically by many drugmakers and health-care experts.
Why, Jane Gaulton, Glen's wife, asked, would Slaoui want that tough job?
"This is good news," replied Gaulton, who, as chief scientific officer at Penn's medical school, connected often with Slaoui when he headed vaccines for GlaxoSmithKline.
"Moncef is not the type of guy to take a job like this if he didn't think we could get something done," Gaulton said.
Glaxo ranks with Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi as the world's dominant vaccine makers. Slaoui "understands vaccines from the ground up, and all the different means vaccines can be developed: isolated proteins, modified virus, RNA, DNA," Gaulton added.
"He had the personal traits to become a leader. He is extremely bright. A very good scientist. Not a guy you can BS. Not a guy you can run things by without a lot of scrutiny. Very thoughtful. Very quick on his feet. A good listener. Assembles information quickly. He has a tremendous passion for data science and bringing products forward."
Slaoui, 60, worked almost half his life at GlaxoSmithKline, joining the firm in 1988 and heading up its vaccines from 2008 until his retirement in 2017. He did not respond, through federal officials, to questions for this story.
Born in Morocco, educated in Belgium and the Ivy League, and a registered Democrat, Slaoui is "a world-renowned immunologist," Trump declared, just the man to run Operation Warp Speed, the public-private project that the president compared to the Manhattan Project that built the atom bomb in World War II.
"One of the most respected men in the world in the production and, really, on the formulation of vaccines," he added. "It's great to have you on board."
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose agency is funding the $10 billion vaccine drive, called Slaoui "arguably the world's most experienced and successful vaccine developer."
On Slaoui's watch, Glaxo produced more than a dozen new vaccines, including ones for malaria, cervical cancer, child gastroenteritis, and Ebola fever. Since leaving Glaxo, as a partner at Switzerland-based venture capital firm Medicxi, Slaoui had invested in a string of biotech start-ups, some of which are promoting vaccine candidates that Slaoui's team would review.
He has remained a fixture on the vaccine global circuit, trading notes at conferences and elsewhere with academics such as Gaulton, government agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and nonprofit powerhouses such as the Gates Foundation.
Slaoui called the president's timeline "very credible" - if "extremely challenging" - and himself "really confident" that a host of official players, from the National Institutes of Health to the U.S. Army, along with the private sector, could "deliver a few hundred million doses by the end of the year."
After his appointment, some critics and leading Democrats said that Slaoui's investments raised ethical questions.
"Dr. Slaoui's had an extensive web of financial interests," faces "potential conflicts of interest," and should "resign" all drug and biotech board seats, U.S. Sens. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), and nine other Democratic colleagues urged in a letter to the White House. Slaoui should also "disclose" ties to firms making COVID-19-related products, and "divest" holdings in such firms, the senators wrote.
Advocacy groups Public Citizen and Lower Drug Prices Now sued to have Slaoui designated a government employee subject to disclosure laws, rather than a contractor. As a contractor being paid $1 for his services, Slaoui is exempt from rules that would require him to reveal all of his outside positions, stock holdings, and other potential conflicts. Nor is the contract position subject to the same conflict-of-interest laws that executive branch employees must follow.
After Trump named him vaccine czar on May 14, Slaoui quit the board of coronavirus-vaccine developer Moderna Inc., and said he would sell his stock options in the company, which have fluctuated in value between $10 million and $20 million as the shares whipsawed in recent weeks. Moderna, a firm worth nearly $30 billion though it has no product or sales, caused a stir earlier this month when it announced positive early tests of its COVID-19 vaccine on just eight volunteers. Investors later bid down the stock after the sketchy results were scrutinized.
Slaoui remained on the board of Vaxcyte, a vaccine developer that on Monday said it plans to go public, disclosing that Medicxi, where Slaoui served as partner, owns shares worth $10 million. (Vaxcyte has not announced plans for a coronavirus therapy.)
Merck chief executive Ken Frazier on Wednesday called Trump's and Slaoui's goal to create a coronavirus vaccine by late 2020 "very aggressive," adding he "would not want to hold" his company's scientists to such a rapid rollout in an industry where safe vaccines typically take years to test before they are deemed safe and effective.
After earning his doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the Free University of Brussels and postdoc projects at Tufts and Harvard, Slaoui chose corporate labs over academe. He joined his first wife, immunologist Claudine Bruck, in Philadelphia working at what was then SmithKline Beckman. The couple raised three sons, then separated; she is now chief executive at Prolifagen LLC.
In 2011, Slaoui married Kristen Belmonte, a Glaxo vice president, and bought a home in Gladwyne for $2.6 million, records show.
Slaoui moved into management at a time when drug companies had been shifting away from the costly in-house research approach, as at Merck. Glaxo in part outsourced key research, engaging Penn specialists to investigate new therapies.
As executive dean at Penn's medical school, Gaulton worked closely again with Slaoui once GSK set up a 10-year research partnership with Penn.
This corporate/academic phase did not endure. The Penn-Glaxo deal wasn't renewed, and drug giants shifted toward the holding-company arrangement pioneered by Johnson & Johnson, in which profits from legacy products were tapped to buy competitors, whole business lines, and promising start-ups.
That made Slaoui a business strategist with billions to spend.
"He knew the big pharma industry had to change. He was progressive the way he thought about that," Gaulton said. "He ushered them through massive change."
Not all Slaoui's bold moves paid off. In 2007 he announced plans for a new Glaxo research center in Shanghai that he said would employ 1,000 scientists and cost $100 million. The deal raised eyebrows: China had a reputation for seeking control of private research. The Shanghai center shut down around the time he left Glaxo. China later convicted the company's top China-based executive of bribery and fined the company nearly half a billion dollars. Slaoui was not accused of any wrongdoing.
In 2008 Slaoui oversaw the $700 million acquisition of Sirtis Pharmaceuticals, and in 2012 the $3 billion acquisition of Human Genome Sciences, both of which failed to deliver big profits from promised drugs.
In 2016 Glaxo named its new Slaoui Center for Vaccines Research at Rockville, Md., in his honor. Six months later he retired, with Glaxo stock worth $10 million. He became a partner with Medicxi, which has offices in Switzerland and London and whose investors include Glaxo and Novartis plus units of Johnson & Johnson and Google parent Alphabet.
He also joined the board of a string of venture-backed firms, including Moderna's, a common step for venture capitalists.
Can such an industry veteran be impartial?
"Let's face it. Anybody who's going to be really good is going to be in the industry," said Penn's Gaulton. "It's almost a given that top people will have relationships."
"But profiting personally from your position is a different thing. Moncef did the right thing" when he pledged to exit his vaccine-developer relationships.
And is a year-end vaccine really possible? Gaulton says he thinks it is.
By his account, manufacturing and packaging have lately grown rapid enough to make it fast and safe to put shots on the street once animal and human testing are complete. Congress has also approved funding to permit vaccine makers to conduct key tests all at once, rather than spreading them out in sequence over months.
Trump said he expected Slaoui's effort to pick at least 14 leading candidates from among the 100-plus now seeking a vaccine.

A new grant from the National Institutes on Aging is funding the creation of a research center at the University of Pennsylvania devoted to improving palliative care for people with dementia living in facilities.
The five-year, $2.5 million grant to the Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center will fund the creation of a second NIA Roybal Center at Penn. These centers are meant to convert research on behavioral and social aspects of aging into practical interventions in the community.
The new center, called Transformative Residential Palliative Care for Persons with Dementia Through Behavioral Economics and Data Science, will be headed by Scott Halpern, director of PAIR and a senior fellow at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at Penn.
There are 13 Roybal centers in the United States; Penn is the only institution with two. Its first is the Roybal Center on Behavioral Economics and Health.
According to the LDI Health Economist, a web-based magazine, the new center will use Genesis HealthCare facilities to test ideas. The center will include researchers from multiple universities, including Harvard, Brown, Yale, and, locally, Drexel and Pennsylvania State.
The first two projects will work to improve physician communication with patients and family members about end-of-life planning and to test an online care planning tool that has been designed for use with patients with dementia in long-term care. sburling@inquirer.com

ABSTRACT
Owner of KoP, Phila. Mills joins with Michael Rubin firm in effort to promote "digital value shopping."
Simon Property Group, the Indiana-based company that owns the King of Prussia Mall and Philadelphia Mills in the Northeast, is joining Conshohocken-based Michael Rubin, who owns online sports merchandise leader Fanatics, in a "digital value shopping" venture to boost store sales through online specials and discounts.
The website, ShopPremiumOutlets.com, has attracted 14 million visitors since a beta version went online in March, according to Simon. The new portal will be managed by Rubin's Rue Gilt Groupe, formed last year to combine Rubin's Boston-based Rue La La high-end retail discount service with member-shopping service Gilt, which Rubin bought from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co. as its sales declined.
The new venture will employ about 900 people, including a Kentucky warehouse operation. At the time of its creation last year, Rue Gilt employed about 750 and claimed sales of about $1 billion.
Simon pledged to help market the venture to the customers at the hundreds of big stores in its properties. The companies said they would pool information on 35 million combined customers.
Rubin, a partner in the 76ers, founded the former GSI Commerce, which managed online sales for retailers competing with Amazon.com. He sold it to eBay in 2011 for $2.5 billion.
He is known in Philadelphia for his advocacy of the rapper Meek Mill, who was freed from prison on parole violation charges after Rubin and other defenders hired a legal, investigative, and public relations team, and has gone on to help lead Reform Alliance, a criminal justice advocacy group. In 2017, Rubin bought the struggling Majestic sports-uniform factory near Easton, Pa.
Rubin's companies have competed with mall chains such as Simon and with online and media-based retailers such as the West Chester-based Qurate Retail Group, owner of QVC and Zulily.
David Simon, chairman and CEO of Simon Property Group, in a statement called the seven-month Shop-PremiumOutlet.com test successful and said the online sales specials complemented the company's stores. "We believe online value shopping presents a tremendous business opportunity for Simon," he added.
Online value shopping is "a massive opportunity ready for the next disruptor," Rubin said. He said Rue Gilt will use the partnership "to quickly surpass $1 billion in sales."
"We are excited to partner with Simon on this innovative e-commerce property," said Mark McWeeny, CEO of Rue Gilt. "Our expertise in e-commerce, data science, curation, and customer experience was the foundation for this partnership."

ABSTRACT
Being away from parents who helped monitor them for years can be a daunting experience, according to a new study.
Nathan Reilly has had type 1 diabetes since he was a baby. And until last week, the 19-year-old always had his mother to help remind him of the litany of tasks people with diabetes must do.
Check blood sugar. Adjust insulin pump. Watch what you eat. Be careful how much you run around.
Now a freshman at Pennsylvania State University, where he is studying data science, Reilly, of Hatboro, is confident that he can manage on his own. He spent much of his senior year of high school practicing the routine, preparing.
But of course, he still worries a little.
A few times in high school, during hockey season, Reilly fell asleep with low blood sugar and experienced a seizure overnight. The experience was scary, but at least his mother was there to take care of him.
"I'm not, I guess, worried about it here, because I'm not playing [hockey] - it's less of a risk. But it's just one thing that I think about," Reilly said.
He's now living in a dorm room. If his blood sugar is low when he tests before bed, Reilly plans to stay awake until it comes up.
Managing a chronic health condition, such as diabetes, can be difficult regardless of age. But a new study suggests that it may be especially challenging for college students, who are adjusting to all the changes that come with campus life, plus managing a complicated disease on their own, without help from their parents, for the first time.
Diabetes distress - which is different from regular stress and anxiety - is high among college students and can negatively affect their quality of life, according to a small survey-based study in Ohio. The study, by researchers at Ohio University and published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, also found elevated diabetes distress among faculty and staff.
"This is a population we need to focus on in terms of addressing their health outcomes," said Elizabeth A. Beverly, an assistant professor of medicine at Ohio University and the study's lead author. "If you're not controlling your diabetes ... for even four years, that can have a major impact in terms of complications down the road."
Diabetes distress is a negative emotional reaction to the experience of living with a condition that requires around-the-clock attention and lifestyle changes.
People with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition in which the body does not produce insulin, must diligently track their blood sugar levels and their carbohydrate intake, and administer insulin. People with type 2 diabetes, where insulin production is compromised, may also need to adhere to nutrition guidelines and take medication.
Frustration with these selfcare requirements, concern about the future and the possibility of developing complications, and perceived lack of support from family and friends can contribute to diabetes distress.
To better understand diabetes distress on university campuses, Ohio University researchers conducted the online survey of students, faculty and staff about their experience managing diabetes in December 2017 and January 2018. The study was funded by a grant from the American Osteopathic Association.
Of the 173 people who completed the survey, 56 were students and 117 were employees. About half of the participants had type 1 diabetes; the remainder had type 2.
The study had some limitations, most notably its small, homogeneous sample size, having been conducted on just one college campus, where a majority of students are white and middle class.
Still, the findings support earlier research that diabetes distress is a significant issue and point to the need for more research among a broader student and faculty population, Beverly said.
About 27% of respondents with type 1 diabetes and 30% of respondents with type 2 reported high diabetes distress. Previous studies have reported lower levels of diabetes distress - about 22% - among broader patient populations.
Students reported higher rates of diabetes distress than faculty and staff, Beverly said.
Feelings of powerlessness, and stress about eating properly and adequately managing diabetes, were the most common concerns participants reported.
Many survey respondents showed signs of severe depression.
Food is something Reilly thinks about a lot, and is an aspect of college he anticipates he'll need to approach with extra care.
"Any of the foods that wouldn't be an issue for just anyone are an issue for me," he said.
Pizza, for example, is loaded with fat and carbs. Reilly must plan carefully to adjust his insulin pump to accommodate the effect a slice would have on his blood sugar levels.
As he starts out in a new school, Reilly wants to make sure the new friends and classmates he meets don't misunderstand what it means to have diabetes. He can't eat whatever he wants whenever he wants, but he is still in control of his life.
"It is kind of a pain to deal with, but a lot of people that I come across are like, 'Oh, you can't do this, you can't do that.' And that's not the case," Reilly said. "I can do pretty much everything someone without diabetes can do. I just have to be careful." sgantz@inquirer.com

DowDuPont Targets More Units to Jettison; News comes before the June 1 final split.

ABSTRACT
News comes before the June 1 final split.
DowDuPont is targeting more of its units for sale even before the company has completed its planned June 1 final split into separate farm-sales (Corteva) and industrial ("new DuPont") businesses.
The "new" DuPont Co. is grouping several units that the company says don't fit into its internal investment targets into a noncore business segment, whose leaders will seek to sell them, or find other ways to boost sales and profits independent of Du-Pont capital allocations.
The targeted noncore businesses include the company's biomaterials; clean technologies; and photovoltaics and advanced materials (including the Hemlock Semiconductor joint venture) units. The noncore group will also include DuPont Sustainable Solutions, and the DuPont Teijin Films joint venture, for which the company had previously said it planned to seek buyers.
Those businesses were culled from all four of DuPont's main business groups: electronics and imaging, nutrition and biosciences, transportation and advanced polymers, and safety and communication.
Executive chairman Edward Breen and CEO-designate Marc Doyle told investors they plan to continue funding in emerging technologies selling, for example, materials for 5G telecom systems in autonomous vehicles, and microbiome products.
Doyle identified the triage candidates in the company's quarterly conference call with investors Thursday morning. He spoke after the company posted a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit report. DowDuPont shares closed at $34.67, down $2.50
(6.73 percent), trading below $36 for the first time since March.
Profits were down for three of Du-Pont's four business groups, with lower demand "partly offset by higher prices," and by strong sales in the safety and construction group, analyst Christopher Muir wrote in a report to clients of CFRA Research in New York. Muir cut his one-year price target for the stock to $42, from $47.
Besides the pending split between DuPont and Corteva, which combines former Dow and DuPont pesticide and seed businesses and is based in Wilmington, a third group, a "materials" company based around a reorganized Dow Chemical at Dow headquarters in Midland, Mich., split off in April.
Rival industrial companies and private-equity buyers, many of them employing former DuPont managers and advised by area law firms, have been circling the Wilmington-based company in recent months, asking to pick off bits of the conglomerate they hope to run more profitably.
They are confident that executive chairman Breen, of New Hope, will repeat his record as chief executive of the former Tyco International Ltd. and continue selling off parts of the company to maximize profits to shareholders and top executives.
Meanwhile, after an initial round of cuts that laid off or reassigned most of the scientists in DuPont's former Central Research Unit, Du-Pont has been announcing new investments in a series of plants around the world, while also upgrading and adding automation equipment and data science labs at the company's Experimental Station west of Wilmington, which state officials once feared the company might close.
Speculation about further asset sales has been frequent at DuPont since Breen announced plans for the three-way spin-off alongside the Dow merger in 2016. One dealmaker hoping to purchase cast-off DuPont units refers to the company as a "dog's breakfast" mix of divergent businesses and opportunities.
Staff have used such terms as "cupcakes to Kevlar," a comment on the wide range of the company's products, and the "Island of Misfit Toys," noting the businesses are more diverse than at Dow or Corteva, to describe the "new" DuPont.
Dividing low-profit-margin, competitive commodities businesses from research-driven new products with potentially higher margins is an established practice at DuPont. In 2015 the company spun off Chemours, which operates legacy chemical businesses - and took over responsibility for many of Du-Pont's potential long-term toxic chemical liabilities - from DuPont's newly refurbished former headquarters on downtown Wilmington's Rodney Square.
Other DuPont spin-offs based in the region include Axalta, a paint company based in Philadelphia; Lycra Co., a Wilmington-based subsidiary of China-based Shangdong Ruyi Investment Holding, which bought some ex-DuPont synthetics from Koch Bros.' Invista, owner of Du-Pont's former nylon units; and Endo Pharmaceuticals, the Chester County-based drugmaker.
There are also a number of companies founded by former DuPont scientists, ranging from family- and worker-owned W.L. Gore & Co., the Newark, Del.-based company, known for Gore-Tex breathable fabrics, to start-ups such as Napigen, a Wilmington-based genome-editing technology developer founded by DuPont alumnus Hajime Sakai, which is developing strains of high-yield wheat.
Napigen, based in the Delaware Innovation Space, run by the University of Delaware, and backed by the state of Delaware, and occupying two former DuPont buildings at the Experimental Station, earlier this week said it raised a$500,000 investment from Breakout Labs.
"It was very natural for us to chose Delaware as our operation site because many of our team members, including me, were former scientists/managers at DuPont, living in the area," said Sakai.

FOR MANY AREA COMPANIES IN 2019, HIRING IS JOB ONE; By Lini S. Kadaba, FOR THE INQUIRER

ABSTRACT
By Lini S. Kadaba, FOR THE INQUIRER
Help wanted!
That's the mantra of many 2019 Top Workplaces in the Philadelphia region as they look at their hiring plans for the next 12 months. Fortunately for them, the prospects of finding the right employees locally are promising, according to nonprofit Philadelphia Works, the workforce development board for Philadelphia County.
"One of the important trends is that we have hiring going on in all skills levels," Meg Shope Koppel, chief research officer for the Center City-based group, said of the 11-county metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that has more than 3 million residents at work in this wider Philadelphia region.
That means all education levels - high school graduates (low skills), post-high school training but not a four-year college degree (medium skills), and college graduates and beyond (high skills) - have plenty of opportunities.
Here are some of the fastest-growing in-demand occupations for each skill level, according to Koppel's analysis of 2019 data from labor market advisers Emsi and analytics software company Burning Glass Technologies' Labor Insights.
· Low skills: Customer service reps, freight and stock material movers, truck drivers, supervisors of food prep and food servers, and retail sales supervisors.
· Medium skills: Health technologists and technicians, wholesale and manufacturing sales reps, food service managers, app developers, and paralegals.
· High skills: Nurses, computer system engineers, management analysts, financial analysts, and financial services sales agents.
One concern, however, is that there are not enough opportunities for middle-skills folks in the Philadelphia region.
"That's something we're working on a lot and will improve over time," Koppel said, noting prospects in health care and computer programming for those without a bachelor's degree. "Middle skills offer the opportunity of really good paying jobs without paying for the full four-year degree. It can be a stepping stone. Those jobs really create a career choice, not just a job, that can lead to wherever you want to go."
Mostly, though, the jobs outlook is bright.
"We're really booming in professional, scientific, and technical services in the region," said Koppel. That's a sector ripe for more growth, especially with interest from venture capitalists and the region's density of research universities as well as start-up incubators, she added. Professional, scientific, and technical services "is a great driver for everything else, because that's where R&D comes from, and that's a predictor of how your other industries do as well."
Top Workplace Vertex, for one, is growing gangbusters. The King of Prussia-based company that provides tax technology and services had "an extraordinary sales year in 2018," said director of talent acquisition Craig Single, and plans to hire for more than 100 jobs locally, possibly as high as 140, and a few dozen more globally.
Jobs include customer support and consulting spots as well as software development and operational areas.
"We have continued to be the only provider offering customers hybrid solutions to their corporate tax needs," Single said. "Every area of the business, from sales, software development, consulting, and all operational areas, have expanded to keep pace with our organic growth."
The tight job market, though, poses challenges.
Unemployment nationally was 3.8 percent as of February. While the MSA for January was higher at 4.1 percent, it is still very much a job seeker's market.
"This makes hiring especially challenging," Single said. He noted the company has looked outside the region at times to fill open positions but mostly finds recruits locally. "We have been successful ... by enabling the business to make quick hiring decisions in this candidates' market."
Besides professional, technical, and scientific services, growing industries prominent in the region include health care and social assistance; finance and insurance; educational services; and arts, entertainment, and recreation, Koppel's analysis found.
Other healthy industries with a smaller footprint in the area include accommodation and food services and construction, she said.
For millennials, ages 23 to 38, and Gen Zers, the oldest in their early 20s, the job outlook is strong. "The jobs are getting more and more interesting," Koppel said. "Young people want to live in the city. We're an affordable city. It all comes together to make it a pretty nice package for someone young looking for first professional jobs."
Independence Blue Cross (IBC), a 2019 Top Workplace, said it expected to hire about 500 people for roles that include customer service, sales, actuarial, technology, research and analytics, data science, and government markets. The Philadelphia-based health insurance organization also plans to recruit nurses and doctors.
"Our region is so rich with talent and employment prospects, which is one of the reasons we prefer and most often recruit locally for our positions," said Jeanie Heffernan, IBC executive vice president and chief human resources officer.
The hardest jobs to fill often require specific skills, she said, and low unemployment only adds to the headache. For example, the insurer is looking for a diabetes health coach who has credentials as a registered nurse and as a certified diabetes educator.
"In some cases, it is taking us longer to find candidates for specific needs," Heffernan said.
While manufacturing is not considered a growth industry, it is the second most important contributor to the Gross Regional Product in the MSA, Koppel said. "Therefore," she said, "efforts to keep manufacturing healthy in the region are critical."
Clemens Food Group is doing its part. The Hatfield pork supplier, a Top Workplace, usually recruits 20 to 25 workers each week, potentially bringing in 1,000-plus new employees over a year, mostly from Philadelphia, Montgomery and Bucks Counties and the Lehigh Valley, according to Keith Stahler, Clemens' director of communications.
"We're constantly growing," he said. Most of Clemens' openings are entry-level, hourly production and warehouse spots, available because of "growth both from a sales perspective and from our team members growing internally into positions that have more responsibility."
For many employers, the Philadelphia region clearly is economically strong with a favorable future in sight.
Said Koppel: "This is the place to be."

Philly's loss ... or win; MISSING THE MARK: While Amazon said no, we've learned a lot to build on.

ABSTRACT
MISSING THE MARK: While Amazon said no, we've learned a lot to build on.
When Amazon launched the competition for its second headquarters location, among the many stated criteria for its decision, proximity to talent stood out. This shouldn't surprise anyone. Irrespective of what type of business an organization is in, the 21st-century economy - and the advanced technology needed to support it - requires a highly educated workforce.
Philadelphia's story - put together by an outstanding partnership between the city Commerce Department and PIDC, the city's economic development corporation, and the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia - was strong enough to get us to a short list of 20 cities, culled from an original list of over 200 cities that made proposals.
We had a great location on the East Coast, a vibrant metropolitan transit network, proximity to a major airport, several sites ready to be developed, and, yes, an abundance of well-educated talent living close to our proposed sites.
But a closer examination of national data reveals where we fell short. After Seattle, the city with the highest percentage of residents who hold a bachelor's degree is Washington. If a city has a well-connected transit system, the standing of the metropolitan area is even more significant.
Where does the Washington metro area rank? First in the nation. Which city and region have the highest percentage of advanced degrees in the nation? Washington. New York is not too far behind in these rankings. But with a population that is many times larger than any other city or metropolitan area, the sheer number of people in New York with the educational level that Amazon wants is very high.
Philadelphia generally ranks in the middle of the pack of important American cities. As a city, we rank 39th in percentage of our citizens with a bachelor's degree, 24th with an advanced degree. Our metropolitan rankings are 17th and 10th, respectively.
We have an extraordinary assemblage of colleges and universities in the city and the region. In the past decade, we have significantly increased the percentage of our graduates who stay here. But despite these great advantages, our underlying educational foundation needs improvement for us to remain competitive, grow our economy, and provide decent jobs at all levels of educational attainment.
This means that we must focus our attention on the quality of our elementary and high schools and ensure that our students are graduating with the essential cognitive and technical skills that will allow them to carry on productive lives. Leaving large segments of our children unprepared is morally wrong and contrary to our own self-interest.
At the higher level of education, our city and region have made great strides in establishing Philadelphia as a center for life sciences and bioengineering. We see this in the proliferation of research and clinical practice at our extraordinary medical institutions. We also see it in the creation of businesses devoted to immunotherapies, making progress to cure diseases previously thought to be incurable.
But as the Amazon experience shows us, we will also need to become more well-known in engineering, computer science, data science, logistics, and business management, among others. We have these resources here in Philadelphia, but the world is also demanding that they be fully integrated with greater levels of community engagement, empathy, and "design thinking," the skills that come from our equally strong base in the social sciences, humanities, and arts. The ingredients are all here. But as any good cook knows, a great meal comes from how you put them together.
At Drexel, our founder, Anthony Joseph Drexel, understood that the world of the late 19th century was radically changing due to advances in industry and technology. He established an institution predicated on the integration of arts, industry, and science that would lift the lives of an urban workforce. We see the same radical changes occurring today, some 125 years later. It is a clarion call to respond again to the needs of our citizens in service to our community.
I come out of this experience with Amazon with enormous appreciation for the inherent resources of our region and for the leadership team that got us so far along in the process. This was a great learning experience for us all, one that will enable us to further dedicate ourselves to becoming a leading city of the 21st century.

Voter turnout

The United States has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the developed world. In 2016, for instance, just under 56 percent of the voting age population cast a ballot in the presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center. In countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Belgium, by contrast, recent participation surpassed 80 percent.
But the United States is a big country, and there are huge regional variations in voter participation within our own borders. At the state level, for example, turnout in the 2016 presidential election ranged from less than 40 percent in Hawaii to nearly 70 percent of the voting age population in Maine and Minnesota.
Drilling down to the county level, as we've done in this map, shows even more variation. To calculate county-level voter turnout, we relied on two data sets: total votes cast in the 2016 presidential election, compiled from official sources by the MIT Election Data & Science Lab, and total citizen voting-age population as calculated by the Census Bureau. The final turnout figure is simply the percent of the citizen voting-age population in a given county who cast a presidential ballot.
The data shows that in the average county, 59 percent of adult citizens voted in 2016. Turnout rates ranged from less than 20 percent in one Georgia county to nearly 100 percent in a number of small southwestern ones.
What's driving those differences? While there's no magic formula that can predict voter turnout in a given community, there are a number of factors that researchers have found, time and time again, to be closely associated with who turns up at the polls.
State policies matter
One of the most striking features of the map above is the effect of state borders on turnout. States such as Tennessee and West Virginia, for example, appear in much darker shades of red than their neighbors. Colorado, on the other hand, is much bluer than surrounding states.
Some of these differences can be traced back to state-level laws on voting access. Tennessee, for instance, has a strict photo ID requirement and allows for vote by mail only under certain circumstances. Colorado, on the other hand, mails out a ballot to every voter in the state and requires only an ID - the non-photo kind - of voters who choose to cast a ballot in person.
Electoral competitiveness matters too
In presidential elections, turnout tends to be higher in battleground states where voters may feel that their votes count for more than they would in a non-battleground state, where the result is essentially a foregone conclusion. You can see this most clearly at play in the map above in Vermont and New Hampshire. Turnout was higher in the latter state, despite its having much stricter voting laws than its neighbor to the west.
Demographic differences
Demographic variables, like race, age and education, also play a significant role in turnout. In 2016, turnout was nearly 30 percentage points higher among Americans age 60 and older than among the 18-29 age group. Whites and blacks were about 15 percentage points more likely to vote than Hispanics. Americans with a postgraduate education were more than twice as likely to cast a ballot as those who hadn't finished high school.
Don't forget about culture
But demographics aren't destiny. Culture and community-level norms regarding civic engagement and voting all play a significant role, too.
What does it mean for 2018?
If researchers know one thing about turnout, it's this: It plummets during midterm years. The plot of U.S. election turnout over time works out to a wild zigzag, with swings between presidential and midterm election years in the neighborhood of 20 percent. The differences are observable across all demographic groups, but they're particularly pronounced for young voters.
How that will all shake out at the county level remains to be seen. County-level turnout is more complicated in midterm election years, since there's no single national-level contest common between all voters. Some states have big Senate and House races drawing a lot of attention this year, while others don't.
One thing that's certain is that interest in the election is running high this year. Google searches for "voter registration," for instance, are at a level that more resembles a typical presidential election cycle rather than a midterm year.

The Lenfest Institute for Journalism will award up to $1 million in grants to drive innovation in news and information products and to sponsor a residency program for entrepreneurs.
Applications are being accepted for two types of grants  ";Experimentation,"; up to $35,000 to help new projects get off the ground, and ";Amplification,"; up to $100,000 to help existing endeavors expand.
Those named as entrepreneurs in residence are expected to be experts in news technology, data science, marketing, or business development who need space and time to explore new projects that align with the institute's mission.
Residencies will last three to six months and include a monthly stipend of up to $10,000. Along with their own projects, the entrepreneurs will act as mentors for other work affiliated with the institute.
The goal is to develop new approaches to sustaining local journalism in Philadelphia and similar metro areas.
";We are laser-focused on ideas with the potential to advance journalism in Philadelphia and metro regions with similar challenges,"; said the institute's executive director, Jim Friedlich. ";We are most interested in applications that address the core business issues of building greater reader engagement, reaching diverse new audiences, and creating new sources of revenue to pay for great journalism.";
The nonprofit, Philadelphia-based Lenfest Institute seeks to preserve and advance local journalism in Philadelphia and elsewhere. It was founded in 2016 by philanthropist H.F. ";Gerry"; Lenfest, who donated Philadelphia Media Network  owner of the Inquirer, the Daily News, and Philly.com  to the institute. The institute does not have editorial control over the papers and website.
Burt Herman, the institute director of innovation projects, will oversee the grant and residency programs.

Wharton study: Immigration proposal will lead to less economic growth and fewer jobs

The proposed Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act, embraced by President Trump last week, would weaken the U.S. economy over the next three decades, according to a            study released Thursday by the Penn Wharton Budget Model.
If the bill, which would reduce overall immigration while boosting the number of educated immigrants, were to become law, the United States in 2040 would have 4.6 million, or 2.1 percent, fewer people employed. If immigration were cut in half, the size of the U.S. economy would be 2 percent smaller in 2040, the research group said.
 If you were just to increase the skill mix of new immigrants to be 75 percent with a college degree or more then in the long run that would increase GDP by 0.37 percent,  said Kimberly Burham, managing director of legislation and special projects.
 Where this bill is taking the hit as far as future economic growth and job growth is concerned is by reducing the total number of immigrants coming in every year,  Burham said.  In the long run, if those immigrants had those jobs, then they would have contributed by working and by saving and there would have been more for everybody. 
The Penn Wharton Budget Model, led by Kent Smetters, a professor in the department of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, was launched last year with the goal of using  advanced economic modeling, big data science, cloud computing, and visualization tools to provide a  sandbox  in which different policy ideas can be tested before legislation is drafted,  the group said in a May news release announcing a $6.6 million grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.
Funders listed on the group s website also include Steve Ballmer, longtime chief executive of Microsoft Corp.; S.A. Ibrahim, former CEO of Radian Group Inc., a Philadelphia mortgage insurer; Marc Rowan, a cofounder and senior managing director of Apollo Global Management L.L.C.; Marc Spilker, founding member of GPS Investment Partners L.L.C. and chairman of Chiron Investment Management L.L.C.; Leonard M. Tannenbaum, chairman and CEO of Fifth Street Asset Management Inc.; and David Trone, founder and president of Total Wine & More, described as the largest privately owned alcoholic beverage chain in the U.S.
All except Ballmer have degrees from Wharton.
A key difference between the Penn Wharton Budget Model and the Congressional Budget Office, which has not analyzed the RAISE Act, is that the Wharton group projects the impact of proposed policies beyond the typical 10-year time frame of the CBO.
While it did not happen with the immigration study,  we re trying to make policy options available before bills are being proposed, so that policymakers can see the impact before they have set their stakes in the ground and made public statements,  Burham said.

IBC, NYU seek to get ahead of diabetes

Independence Blue Cross said Monday that it would spend close to $1 million over three years in a research collaboration with New York University to spot cases of undiagnosed diabetes and predict who is vulnerable for developing the disease.
 IBC's contribution includes a $600,000 grant and other support. The researchers at NYU's Initiative in Data Science and Statistics will apply artificial-intelligence tools to IBC's medical and pharmacy claims data to predict the future rather than analyze the past.
 "We feel that this can be a game-changer," Somesh Nigam, a senior vice president and chief informatics officer at IBC, said in an interview.
 "Without a doubt, improved ways to accelerate the diagnosis of diabetes in affected people will improve health, reduce the complications of the disease, and reduce health-care costs," Ann Marie Schmidt, a professor of endocrinology and medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a participant in the research with IBC, said in a statement.
 Leading the collaboration is NYU's David Sontag, an assistant professor of computer science. Sontag's research into methods of predicting diagnoses based on an analysis of keywords in patients' conversations with nurses caught IBC's attention, Nigam said.
 IBC's hope is that the research will help improve care and trim spiraling health-care costs by making early intervention possible, Nigam said. As it is now, "people sometimes show up at their doctor's doorstep and the disease is far along." 
 The collaboration is just starting, with IBC preparing for the transfer of data. As part of the arrangement, NYU experts will train IBC analysts.

On the House: Survey gives low marks to Philadelphia, except for commute and walkability

At last count, there were a zillion Internet sites catering to apartment dwellers, of which Apartment List's is neither the greatest nor the least. 
All these sites conduct surveys. Most are silly, and so forgettable that I cannot even offer you an example. 
I'm not going to forget the latest survey at Apartmentlist.com, however, because of how Philadelphia appears to be perceived by renters here: 18,000 were surveyed nationally; a local number was not provided. 
The bottom line: Renters gave Philadelphia a C-minus for city satisfaction, ranking it 80th of 100 cities surveyed. 
Confidence in the local economy correlates strongly to city satisfaction, and Philadelphia earned a D, with only 15 percent of renters saying it is on the right track. 
That put Philadelphia 89th among the 100 cities. 
One of Philadelphia's better scores was a B for quality of daily commute - 67 percent of survey respondents expressed satisfaction. 
Except . . . 
"It's a good thing Philly is a very walkable city, because parking is a pain and the public transit system is spotty, at best," according to the study, provided by Andrew Tam, vice president of data science for Apartment List. 
Philadelphia is a walkable city. It is one of the things I've always liked about it. 
I've also been riding the Broad Street Subway and the El a lot recently to get to assignments, and I've enjoyed the experience a lot more than I did when I arrived here 35 years ago. 
Keep in mind that the expansion of Center City north and south follows the route of the Broad Street Line. 
Jeff Kurtz, who bought a house in the East Passyunk Crossing area of South Philadelphia in 2012, emphasized in a recent interview that the proximity of the Tasker-Morris Station is a factor in the decision-making of many of that neighborhood's residents - and likely of those in other areas of greater Center City. 
I have had similar conversations with new residents of Francisville and Newbold about the availability of public transit being a factor in their decision to buy in those places - and in developers' decisions to build rental and for-sale housing there. 
SEPTA's Regional Rail also has gotten better since I was a daily rider. I use it for a lot for my Town by Town visits because it is often faster than driving and a more direct route downtown to downtown. 
The suburbs, too, are hooked on mass transit. Look at formerly on-the-ropes boroughs in the midst of a renaissance: Ambler, Media, Doylestown, Downingtown, to name a few. 
Steven Gilbert, who has lived just outside Ambler since 2006, summed it up this way: "Convenience to the regional rail [the Doylestown-Lansdale line], great restaurants . . . [and] small-town feel." 
For Mayor Norman Hawkes, a big part of Hatboro's viability is "our walkable access to SEPTA's Regional Rail system [the Warminster Line], which has direct access to Center City and the airport." 
The difference between me and the author of the Apartment Line appraisal, however, is that I buy a ticket at Jefferson Station before boarding the train. 
"And don't even bother planning to catch a free ride for just a stop or two on one of the suburban trains that pass through the city," the author of the Philadelphia entry wrote. 
"The conductors are on to that trick, and they'll embarrass you in front of the whole car," the author wrote, adding, "Um, not that we'd know." 
Three cheers to those conductors from us paying riders. If there were still a bar car on the Paoli Local, I'd hoist my glass to them.
